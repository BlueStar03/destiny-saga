# Redn

In the World of Threa, there are 21 races. This is a description of a race that lives in the world of Threa, the Redn. That I will describe

---

The Redn are simple folk that farm and ranch, bothering no one.

---

On their appearance they are tall, lanky, and skinny. Their skin is a gray tone. They have many patches across their skin. Those patches can be pale green, pale red or pale blue. They have a tall cylindrical head, with the top of their head being flat. They have small sunken eyes. Their irises are a deep blood red. The skin around their eyes is black. They have no nose structure, no cartilage on their nose. They have an underbite. They have fangs on their lower jaw. They have large winglike ears. their hair, and facial hair for males, grows in patches. They can have red or blue hair. They have tall and thin necks. their belly caves inward, they have a gaunt, emaciated look. They have long and lanky arms. They have six fingers. Two of those fingers are very long and have webbing in between forming bat like wings, which they use for flight. They have short legs; they tend to be splayed at their sides. They have three toed feet. they have opposable thumbs in their feet. They can grip poles and handle items with their feet. They often hang upside down.  

---

They are capable of flight. if they can, they will fly to their destination. they otherwise walk on all fours. they enjoy perching on lines, bars or edges. one thing they do is get their pitchfork stuck on the ground and they perch on the handle.They are capable of flight. if they can, they will fly to their destination. they otherwise walk on all fours. they enjoy perching on lines, bars or edges. one thing they do is get their pitchfork stuck on the ground and they perch on the handle. their feet are quite dexterous. they often handle items with their feet, rather than with their hands.

They live in the southern farmlands. Part of their territory is under their control, the heartland. while at the edge of their territory, the yonderlands, it is under the control of neighboring nations. They do integrate well with the nations on the yonderlands. They are known for their hospitality. They maintain good relations with their neighbors. Still, they know that they would not be able to defend their territory. Their bodies are frail, nor do they have the numbers, and all they have as a weapon are pitchforks. When push comes to shove, they will defend their territory, especially the heartlands. Nonetheless, they prefer to avoid conflict. They do so by being good neighbors. "The best defense is a warm apple pie" they say.


---

Their weapon of choice is the pitchfork. but it is more of a necessity than an actual weapon. Redn don't have any military in any capacity. if they need to defend themselves, a pitchfork is the best thing available to them

Pitchfork: poor slash, good pierce, fair blunt, high reach, good speed, fair defense, good condition. Two-Hand wield

Shovel: fair slash, poor pierce, good blunt, high reach, good speed, good defense, good condition. Two-Hand wield. Effect: resist stagger

Hoe: good slash, poor pierce, good blunt, high reach, good speed, fair defense, good condition. Two-Hand wield. Effect: easier parry

Hay fork: poor slash, good pierce, poor blunt, high reach, good speed, fair defense, good condition. Two-Hand wield. Effect: high critical hit rate

Garden fork: poor slash, good pierce, good blunt, good reach, fair speed, fair defense, good condition. Two-Hand wield. Effect: High chance to disarm

Harvest pitchfork: poor slash, good pierce, poor blunt, good reach, poor speed, high defense, good condition. Two-Hand wield. Effect: Faster regeneration when perch

Rock fork: none slash, poor pierce, good blunt, good reach, poor speed, high defense, high condition. Two-Hand wield. Effect: splash damage

Weeding fork: fair slash, good pierce, poor blunt, fair reach, high speed, poor defense, good condition. One-Hand wield. Effect: can be dual wielded. High chance to disarm on parry, high critical hit rate, easier parry, reduces pivot maneuvering.

Because they are not designed for combat, The pitchork and its variants have poor combat performance. The handles are made of common wood, and the tips are typically iron. It is possible to use armories of their neighbors and allies to forge a combat pitchfork

Combat Pitchfork: good slash, high pierce, fair blunt, excellent reach, good speed, good defense, good condition. Two-Hand wield: faster regeneration on perch, easier Perry, high disarm rate on parry, resist stager

They wield their weapons with their feet. their arms which are their wings, are used to fly and hover while engaged. They can use their pitchfork to quickly pivot and help maneuver.


---

Likewise, they don't really produce combat armor. The only thing that may count as armor is their rugged overalls.  

Rugged overalls: light Weight, fair defense, poor slash, poor pierce, fair blunt, neutral mobility, fair condition, effect, increases glancing blow rate.

---

They utilize a number of options to avoid combat. Their hospitality and neutrality does help deter most conflicts, with some of their neighbors actually defending them. if that isnâ€™t enough, they may lay traps in their territory. one of their most extreme options is torched earth tactics. They deliberately destroy their own land to deny the adversary its use. If they do face the invaders head on, they will try one last approach and use intimidation. They highlight their large wingspan, and let out ear piercing screeches, and at night, their glowing blood red eye also adds to the intimidation.


---

If they come to blows, maybe their unconventional fighting might give them an edge. they can take flight, and maneuver around their enemy, avoiding their attacks. They use their pitchforks to quickly pivot, digging their pitchfork into the ground, or any other surface, creating an anchor they can use to reposition and leap off from. Because they wield their pitchfork with their feet, they are always ready to attack or defend. As long as they can keep it up, constantly dodging and attacking, they may come out on top. Since they rely on being lightweight to fly, they can't wear armor. Their rugged overalls are just lightweight enough to not hinder their mobility. yet only a few lucky blows will take them out. They have had some victories, but also some losses. their territory used to be larger. part of what is now the yonderlands, used to be part of the heartlands.


---

A common saying is "Father knows best". This reflects how the father is head of the household. fathers are sought out for wisdom and advice. Their governance is quite simple. they just have a Mayor in their town. The Mayor may appoint anyone for their cabinet at their leisure. The appointment and replacement of Mayors isn't to formal. As long as the Mayor isn't doing a bad job, they end up keeping the job their entire life. Maybe the Mayor appoints their replacement, maybe the next mayor is voted in, maybe someone just steps in to fill the vacancy, or maybe they go without a Mayor for some time. There is no administration above a Mayor.

---

Their clothing is reminiscent to real world cowboys. they have cowboy style hats, plaid shirts, leather vest, bandanas, large belt buckle, rugged blue pants and rugged blue overalls. They are good at farming and ranching. they help provide food to their neighboring nations in the yonderlands.

The Southern Farmlands are a vast fertile flat valley. The ancestral home of the Redn since time before memory. As other races moved across Threa, they came across the Southern Farmlands. such fertile soil became highly coveted. Other races started to encroach upon the Redn territory. Being simple farmers and ranchers, they were unable to defend themselves against professional armies. but rather than to harden themselves, to bear arms and reconquer their lost lands, they offer to tend those lands for the new occupants. while there was initial skepticism, why a defeated people would willingly benefit their conquerors. Nonetheless, the Redn's expertise of the land brought more bounty than their own farmers. This mutual cooperation formed. While others claim possession of the yonderlands, the Redns still tended those lands. the bounty was plenty enough for themselves and their conquerors, their new allies and neighbors. additionally, this stopped further encroachment into the heartland. furthermore, their new allies provided defense against others that coveted the fertile soil of the southern farmlands.
