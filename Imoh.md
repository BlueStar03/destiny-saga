# Imoh

In the World of Threa, there are 21 races. This is a description of a race that lives in the world of Threa, the Imoh. That I will describe

---

The Imoh are a simple patriarchal tribal society that is fully isolated from the rest of the world due to living on the other side of an impassable mountain range.

Regarding their appearance, they are relatively short at no more the 5' tall. they have snow white skin. Their hair and eyes are vibrant reds, oranges, and violet. They have bushy eyebrows. Male may grow mustaches. Their hands resemble mittens, one broad finger and a thumb. They have two toed feet. Their clothing selection includes sandals with socks, loafers, boots shorts, pants, short sleeve shirts, headbands. The elders wear a blue vest. Their pants, shorts, boots sandals and loafers tend to be brown, everything else can be white, light gray, or light blue, with some red trims. because of the comfortable shift in temperature, they feel comfortable wearing what looks like summer attire during freezing temperatures.

An interesting property of the Imoh is that their comfort level in regard to temperature is lower than average. even in freezing cold temperature, they may just feel a bit chilly. As such, their clothing appears more suited for a hot summer rather than the cold environment they live in. sandals, shorts, and short sleeve shirts. A possible consequence is that they may feel sweltering hot in what otherwise is the average room temperature. However, since they have not ventured beyond blue mountains, it is unconfirmed if that is the case.

The Imoh live fully isolated from the rest of the world. On the other side of the perilous Blue Mountain Range, there is the vast snowy plain that the Imoh call home. Because of the Blue Mountains, only a few intrepid explorers have even successfully crossed it and returned to even acknowledge the existence of a group of people on the other side. The Imoh themselves call the mountain sierra as Aurora Sierra. They wouldn't know that the rest of the world calls it Blue Mountains. it is on the western border of the snowy plains. the rest is surrounded by harsh waters. The Snowy Plains itself are very calm and vast

---

Their societal structure is simple. They are organized in tribes, with a single elder governing the tribe. The elder is always male. His wife can provide counsel if needed. It is the elder who chooses their successor. and they decide when they will retire. if an elder passes without a successor. The eldest person in the tribe becomes the elder. However, they may deem themselves too old to govern so they name a successor and retire immediately. Some individuals do try to curry favor with the elder so they may be chosen but it never works. Their buildings are igloo style. The outer domes are built of compacted snow, more space is achieved by having the main compartments below ground level. Their farming is unique since they live in a vast field of snow. They first need to uncover the ground to plant seeds. After seeding, they build structures with compact snow to cover the entire field protecting the plants from the cold. they mark the spot of the field. When ready to harvest they locate and uncover the field. They harvest mainly berries and other useful plants. they are also expert fishers. They break the ice over frozen water and fish. They very easily get large catches, but they only take what they need. Because of their isolation, there really isn't much conflict. There is plenty of space for the tribes for their use. They have no military or police. they do have martial competitions for entertainment, with the nunchuk as their weapon of choice. they hold various festivities, competitions, and meditative sessions. inter tribals interaction is ecurage. many families are mix tribe families. 

---

The Imoh are fully isolated, so they don't maintain a military, and the tribes are small enough that no policing is needed. so, they don't poses any combat classes. Nonetheless, they do maintain a martial tradition. but this ins mor for meditation and exhibition matches than for any fighting. The exhibition matches are not fights but singles performances. Each performance is judged by skill, composition, creativity, precision, akin to dancing.

Imoh produced nunchuck are not used in combat, rather for performance. still, they can technically be used in combat. but because of their isolation and peaceful environment, Imoh, produced nunchucks have not been used in combat at all. they are built with soft woods and rope
Nunchuck: none slash, good blunt, none pierce, high speed, fair reach, good defense, one hand wield.
Light Nunchuck: none slash, fair blunt, none pierce, excellent speed, fair reach, fair defense, one hand wield. effect: High Stun rate
Practice nunchuck: none slash, fair blunt, none pierce, good speed, fair reach, fair defense, one hand wield. effect: cannot deplete opponents health
Training nunchuck: none slash, high blunt, none pierce, fair speed, fair reach, high defense, one hand wield. effect: Non-lethal final hit 
Triple nunchuck: none slash, high blunt, none pierce, high speed, good reach, high defense, two hand wield. effect: High Stagger, High Knockback
Competition nunchuck: none slash, high blunt, none pierce, excellent speed, good fair, high defense, one hand wield. effect: High Stun, stun on critical  High Stagger, High Knockback, Non-lethal final hit 


Nunchuks are produced in the rest of Threa, but not many. Since the isolated Imoh are the one that receive the affinity boost from nunchucks, no one beyond the snowy plains can take full advantage of nunchuks. so armories in Threa find little reason to make nunchucks besides as a novelty weapons. nonetheless unlike Imoh produced nunchucks, armory produced nunchuks are capable weapons. If only could they be wielded by an Imoh to be used to their full potential. they are built with chains and hard woods or metals.
chucks: none slash, high blunt, none pierce, good speed, fair reach, good defense, one hand wield. effect: stun on critical
