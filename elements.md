# Elements

The Elements created Threa. Earth, Water, Fire and Wind.

---

Earth, Water, Fire, and Wind are more like names. A simple way to explain their nature.
Fire is Radiance. just like fire radiates light and heat, or even a smile or a frown radiates happiness or sadness.
Wind is Force. like how wind pushes against the mountains or thought pull on the body.
Earth is Firmness. That which holds shape. Like a rock, or a mountain, or bones and flesh.
Water is Fluidity. That which moves. Like the rives and oceans and blood

---

They are sentient beings. with their own personalities. Fire is like an arrogant jock. Wind is a competitive cheerleader, Earth is a shy geek, and Water is a carefree airhead

---

Fire and Earth are "male" Water and Wind are "female". Earth and Water are "Young adults" and Fire and Wind are "Adults". Fire and Water as "Siblings" as are Wind and Earth

---

Before Threa, Fire and Wind saw each other as rivals. Earth had a crush on Water, but Water paid him no mind. During the creation of Threa, Fire and Wind worked together, as did Earth and Water. From their work, each couple enjoyed ech others company. From this, emerged Ice and Lightning.

---

Ice and Lightning are the Neo Elements. They both are "Children" and best friends. Ice is introverted and "male". Lightning is extroverted and "female"

---

because Earth and Water, Firm and Flow, Ice is matter, existence, what can be acted upon.
Fire and Wind, Radiance and force, Lightning is energy, action, what acts upon.

---

Ice made the plant, life that is acted upon. Lightning made animals, life that acts

---

then together, Ice and Lighting created Sentience, life that can act and be acted upon. these were the Nawa. the First people. from seeing the creation of the Nawa, Fire and Wind created the Aetha, and Earth and Water created the Dreavi.

On their appearance:
They look as if theyâ€™re made of Eura. It seems to flow upward from their legs, through their bodies, and branch out into their arms and head. This gives them an ethereal, ghostlike appearance. These Eural wisps have an immaterial glow that shimmers in their respective colors: red for Fire, magenta for Wind, green for Earth, cyan for Water, blue for Ice, and yellow for Lightning.

---

Fire's body is that of a tall, lean, and strong man, glowing in red. His wisps flicker like flames, rising upward from his head as if his hair is made of fire.

Wind's body resembles a graceful lady, glowing in magenta. Her Eural wisps swirl around her, and two long, flowing tails emerge from her head, curving downward and outward.

Earth's body is stout and broad, like that of a youthful man, with long, strong arms. His green Eural wisps form into hard, solid lines, and two blocky flops hang at the sides of his head.

Water's body is that of a youthful woman. Her cyan wisps flow and splash across her body, with four tendrils trailing down from her head.

Ice's body is that of a young boy. His blue wisps crystallize into snowflakes, and crystal spikes crown his head.

Lightning's body is that of a young, energetic girl. Her yellow wisps crackle across her body, and bolts of lightning shoot down from her head.
