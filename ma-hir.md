# Ma Hir

## Appearance

### Body

- **Head & Facial Features:** No external nose; smooth, dolphin-like skin streamlines movement. Three stout fins rise from the crown—females bear graceful, flowing tendrils, while males display stouter lobes (often tipped with prominent barbels). Cyan and light-blue markings streak the snout “brow” and may extend across shoulders or fins.
- **Coloration:** Base hues range from deep ocean-blue to rich purple, accented by bioluminescent-like patches in cyan or pale blue. Individual or clan patterns may appear on fingers, toes, or trailing tendrils.
- **Limbs & Locomotion:** Broad, flattened arms end in four webbed “flipper” fingers; two-toed flipper feet mirror this design. A short, paddle-shaped tail completes their propulsion system—powerful for steering but too stubby to drive long-distance thrust.
- **Sexual Dimorphism:** Beyond head-crest shapes, females often carry subtler, thinner tendrils that trail like ribbons; males’ lobes are thicker, and barbels may bristle during displays of strength or emotion.

### Clothing

- **Silhouettes & Fabrics:** Simple robes, draped togas, billowy shirts, and flared pants dominate—cut to flow with undercurrents and minimize drag. Fabrics are woven from kelp fibers or scaled hide, chosen for buoyancy and tear resistance.
- **Palette:** Earthy tones (browns, muted yellows, olive greens) contrast their cool-toned skin, echoing sand, surfgrass, and shallow reefs.
- **Function & Ornament:** Loose cuts allow free swimming; layers can be added for warmth near vents or stripped away in tropical shallows. Decorative trims—thin bands of silver thread or colored kelp ribbons—denote rank, clan affiliation, or recent achievements without impeding motion.
