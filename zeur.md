# Zeur

In the World of Threa, there are 21 races. This is a description of a race that lives in the world of Threa, the Zeur. That I will describe

---

The Zeur are a matriarchal mercantile people. males are the property and labor of females.
on their physical appearance, they have features of bovine and hoofed creatures, their skin is covered in fine fur. with a wide variety of patterns. they have orange eyes. the have box snouts. four finger hands, two hoofed, digitigrade feet. muscular build with broad shoulders. they have horns. their horns can resemble those of cows and bulls as well as those of deer. They have long floppy ears and a short tail with a tuff of hair. When they are young, there isn't much difference between males and females, with females being slightly taller. beginning at there late teen, the males start growing much larger. female tend to average 4.5 feet tall. males can peak at 7 feet tall. when they reach about 30 years old, males start to hunch and use their arms to support their weight. they start walking on all fours. at this point they are no longer viable to start a family.

---

a typical family consist of the Boss female, Wife female, multiple Husband males, a Prize male, and the children of the Boss and Prize . The Boss female is the head of the household and owner/operator of the business. then there is the Wife female. she is the main partner and companion for the Boss, she also deals with administration and service of the business. then there are one or more husband males. they were bought at auction from their mothers. The husbands provide the labor for the business. having two husbands is considered successful, with more well off families having up to five or six husbands. one husband is the Prize and they will be the father of the Boss's children. And then the Boss's Children which the Wife takes care of. any male children will eventually be sold of at auction as husbands

---

The Boss is the head of the household. the Wife is their main partner. while it could be strictly business, they are often romantic partners, with courtship and couple stages. the Boss - Wife marriage is the one that receives a ceremony. the Boss's marriages with their husbands is basically when they purchases them. The Boss may develop romantic feeling with any of her husbands. thou not usually for the Prize. he is more to show off the Boss's status

---

The Zeur have no nation of their own, no territory. they live among the other races. their business prowess makes them valuable in the communities they live. The Boss is the owner - operator of her business - family. be it a shop, cafeteria, transport, mining and any other business endeavors.

---

A common businesses venture a Zeur business - family engages involve earthworks. Digging, mining, demolition and other opportunities. A common tool Zeur posses is a Pick Hammer. This tool helps facilitate various earthwork tasks. a Zeur Pick Hammer is a large and solid slag of hard metal. one end is flat and blunt, the other end is sharpened to a point. it has some leather straps for ease of use. because of the size difference, males and females wield a Pick Hammer differently. a female uses both hands to wield and maneuver. for a male Zeur, they are strapped to their hands, like a brass knuckle. it is also useful for bolstering the safety and security of the family.

---

Zeur clothing is simple and sturdy. The use thick fabrics, like burlap for durability. they also use ropes for ornamentation. Female clothing is well kept, and made with vibrant colors. Male clothing colors with beige, brown and off white, male clothing also tend to be in tatters, except for the Prize husband, and male children. their clothing exhibit similar care and colors as female garments.

---

the full family unit is composed of the Boss, the Wife, one or more Husbands, the Prize, and the family's children. however, other configurations exist. the boss and one husband. since at least one husband is needed to have labor for the business. the lone husband would be the father of the boss's children. However, as long as the husband is younger then 30. Older husband are cheaper, but at their peak strength. So it is a good start of a family - business for poor zeur.
the boss and her wife. this setup is good for clerical or administrative business. basically jobs that are not physically demanding. this setup is also more romantic. later in their life they may get a husband, or a prize, so the boss may have her children.  
Boss, Wife and husband. basically no prize. Prizes are young zeur, and are very expensive. the boss may not indulge in such luxurious expense. she would use a husband for her children, as long as the husband is younger than 30 years.  
Boss, Wife and Prize. after a long life together, a boss and her wife decide to buy a prize, an indulgence for them  
Boss and Prize. this is rare, this indicates that the Boss comes from a rich family, as she was able to afford a prize as her first purchase. the prize, being young, is a very good purchase as he has many years to be viable.
Multiple Prizes, be it just a boss, or a boss and wife. Having multiple prizes indicates their incredible wealth. Being able to buy multiple young male zeur is a very expensive endeavor. Prizes zeur star at age 20, they are still growing, yet to reach their peak strength at age 30. Each one is higly viable for the family - business

---

buying their first husband passed 30 years does carry stigma. the husband can be used to start a family, and while at their peak strengths has few years left as useful labor. in turn there is also stigma for the mother unable to sell her son until such late age. it reflects badly at her.

---

Life of a male Zeur:
birth - 15 years
when they are children, they are slightly smaller than female children. if the family has a wife, she will care the him, otherwise it would be the boss. they are well kept and pampered.
15 - 20
at about age 15, is when they start growing larger than females, their muscles start to bulk up. at this point is that the boss takes interest in their care, if they were cared by the wife. the boss makes sure the continue to grow big and strong.

---

20 - 25
at age 20 is when their boss, their mothers begin to sell them. it could be informal, just coming up to a female zeur and asking if they would purchase their son. or it could be at a seasonal market auction, where multiple mothers gather to sell their sons, and bosses gather to buy them. if they are bought, if they are wedded between 20 and 25 years, they are purchased as Prizes. they have youthful looks, and are considered handsome. their bosses have the longest time to start a family with them. their bosses would pamper them and display them. and may limit their labor, if they can afford to do so. they are at their most expensive, and would bring a good amount of money

---

25 - 30
if sold between 25 and 30 years of age, they are sold as husbands. they have a few years left to start a family, and still plenty of years for labor. at this point, they have reach their peak height, at about 7 to 8 feet tall. their muscles still continue to bulk up, they have yet to reach their peak muscle bulk. they don't fetch the high price  they would have when they were younger. it is at this point in which they start to be used as labor, if they weren't already. they will also receive their last set of good clothing, as they have finished getting taller.

---

30 +
at age 30 and beyond, they can no longer be used to start a family, purely labor. at this point, their muscle have reached their maximum bulk, their peak strength. because of their size, their gait changes from bipedal to quadrupedal, they start walking on their knuckles. they have not new clothes for a while, the colors have faded to browns and beige. the hems have come undone., giving them a tattered appearance. at this point they are sold cheaply. since they are at their peak strength, is it a good purchase for a young boss, starting their businesses - family

---

to their mother. since it is a transactional wedding, they now belong to their bosses, and their mothers, their family, have no claim on them. while their mothers and family may see them as a prized possession, they may also have familial sentiment, as  son and brother. making the sell a somber moment as they may never see each other again.

---

While they remain unsold, past the age of 20 they are still with their mothers, they serve their mothers family -business as labor. however, at a limited basis, as they would not want their son to come to injury, risking a potential sell.

20 - 25
this is a crucial point in their lives. as the decisions here have a profound impact. she basically has three options, start a relationship, a business, or a family. She may continue to pursue a meaningful relationship with their girlfriend, and end up marring them. if they pursue this at this time, business and family would come later in life. they may continue to be employed with their mothers, or seek employment elsewhere. if they chose to start a business, they would purchase a husband. they may focus on establishing their business before having a relationship or starting a family. if they focus on starting a family first, they may purchase a young husband, or even a prize. however this is more for affluent females, as they can afford to delay their own business, or have meaningful relationship

at this point, they would be expected to be well established. depend on their early decision.
if they pursued marriage. they have a strong emotional foundation with their partner. more experienced together to start their business. they may have saved up a fair amount of money, might get a young husband, multiple older husbands, or even a prize. so they are well position to start both a business and a family
if they started there business young, maybe by buying a cheap older husband. they may have many failed ventures, as they were alone with little experience, as males are not educated in business, so cant really provide much support. nonetheless, she may have developed romantic feeling for her husband. if they have been successful at this point, they may pursue a relationship, or start a family, or continue to develop their business and get another husband.
for those that chose family, are in a great position. their husbands are ready to work, having already fathered her children, and she can transition them to start her business, she may get a wife to care for her children.

Who is the Boss and who is the Wife? during courtship, the couple doesn't have distinctions on who is the Boss and who is the wife. that is established at the wedding. typically the more assertive, the more aggressive would be the Boss. while the more passive and submissive of the two would be the wife. however, it could also arise from mutual agreement, resulting with the passive one being the Boss and the aggressive one being the Wife. thou it could also be that both are either passive, or aggressive.If two Bosses are to wed, that is that they had already a business and/or a family, one has to submit to the other, and become the wife. in this instance of wedding - merger, the boss assumes ownership of the wife's husbands and children.
Typically, the Boss bares the children of the family. in some families, it is the wife that bares their children. in rare instances it is both.
typically it is the Prize that fathers the children. however any husband younger than 30 years can father children.  in some instances, this happens if they feel like time is running out. their husband is about to be 30, and don't see themselves ever purchasing a prize.

Karin married Rina. Karin being the Boss and Rina her Wife. they started a restaurant. the restaurant struggled at the beginning, but soon it started to boon. a few years later, Rina left Karin and took most of their savings. this devastated Karin. at this point, Karin wanted a husband, but could only afford a 35 year old Tau. too old to start a family, but was strong, kind and loyal. so she married/purchased Tau. He was used to expand her business into shipping, in addition for shipping supplies to her restaurant. she ended up hiring two non zeur to help with the restaurant. her shipping business with Tau took off.
some years later, Karin and Tau were to pick up deliver goods to a shop. it turns out that Rina was running that shop by herself. Karin was furious at her, for stealing from her and leaving. Rina apologized and begged for forgiveness. Rina told Karin that in order to improve the restaurant busines, she made a few bets, she gambled to raise money. however, she got into a lot of debt, and the collectors were about to go after karin and the restaurant. so Rina stole the money to pay off the debt and then she fled. eventually they patched things up and remarried - merger. to show her apprsciation, Rina bought Mikke, a prize for Karin.
