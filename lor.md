# Lor

In the World of Threa, there are 21 races. This is a description of a race that lives in the world of Threa, the Lor. That I will describe.

---

On their physical appearance: Of Basal form, they have four digits on their hands and feet, with pointed fingertips. They have skin-covered horns on top of their heads. Their skin color ranges across various tints and shades of red, pink, orange, and magenta. Their hair and eyes are vibrant reds and oranges, and rarely yellow. As they age, their hair darkens to black. The sclera of their eyes is black. Males tend to be taller than females; males can approach 7 feet tall, while females average 4.5 feet. They have full range of builds, mostly slim or lanky, but can also be lean, muscular or plump

---

Their "horns" function as ears. The horns have bone underneath them, with stretched skin over the top. They come in two varieties: outward or upward. A sharp point tends to indicate a healthy, strong, well-fed person. Tall horns also indicate the person’s healthy upbringing. Tall, sharp points contribute to their attractiveness. Overfeeding and overindulgence, as is common with aristocrat males, tends to round the point. Other reasons that tend to round, blunt, or shorten the horns include malnutrition, starvation, stress, and overall hardships during upbringing. The bone can crack and be seen through the skin. The horn can completely break off as well, which may indicate a past significant trauma. A cracked horn never heals; a broken horn will never grow back. While it varies by individual, some feel pride in their damaged horn, seeing it as part of an incredible tale in which they were victorious. But more commonly, it is viewed with some level of shame—some failure on their part that led to the damage or loss of the horn. It may even be viewed as a sign of being somewhat disabled.

---

The shape of the horn has limited influence on hearing. Generally, outward, tall, and pointed shapes tend to offer better hearing compared to upward, short, and rounded ones. However, the effect is minimal, resulting in only a slight increase in sensitivity. A more significant factor affecting hearing is damage to the horn. Hairline cracks have a small but noticeable impact, to the extent that some intentionally crack and carve their horns for aesthetic reasons, accepting the minor loss of hearing. In contrast, losing mass from the horn leads to a more considerable decline in hearing ability; retaining at least half of one horn still allows for reliable hearing, but anything less renders one effectively deaf.

---

The Lor are a race of people with vast kingdoms throughout the land. They live under a harsh patriarchy. Their kingdoms are headed by a king, and the aristocracy administers his rule. They have vast armies and a lowly peasantry.

---

One characteristic of Lor patriarchy is that women are essentially owned by their husbands. The traditional adornment worn by wives resembles fetters. Peasant wives don simple wooden or rope fetters on either their ankles or wrists, while wealthier wives wear more intricate and decorative fetters with long metal chains on both their ankles and wrists. These are not necessarily seen in a negative light; they are comparable to wedding rings. It is common for some peasants to save money to purchase a nice metal fetter to propose to their beloved. Female identity is closely linked to their husbands, as they are identified as the storekeeper’s wife or Jora’s wife, rather than by their own names. If unmarried, they are referred to by a close male relative, such as the farmer’s sister, the soldier’s mother, or Alim’s daughter. Peasants tend to be more egalitarian; female peasants actively contribute to their community and can express their opinions more openly, yet men still maintain authority over them. Aristocratic men exercise their power over the women in their families, believing that a quiet wife is a good wife.

---

The Lor possess large armies that serve at the king’s discretion. They are utilized for maintaining territorial control and stability, as well as for guarding, law enforcement, defending and expanding territory, and confronting other kings and kingdoms. Only males are drafted into service. Their armor is minimal, primarily worn beneath decorative tunics. A notable piece of their armor is the pauldron — a solid metal covering for the shoulders, back, and part of the front chest — typically gold/yellow in color, created using pyrite for the effect. These may also feature ornaments. Their preferred weapon is the Razor. A Lor Razor is a sizable, curved metal blade with sharpened edges on all sides. It has a small handle embedded within the curve for gripping and maneuvering, resembling real-world scimitars with its curved edge.

---

Peasants are drafted, conscripted or enlisted, into the military, where they receive training and are compensated well. If they endure the campaign, they return not only with their wages but also with any plunder they have acquired. A conscript has the option to remain in the army, eventually becoming a veteran, a mentor, and a trainer who offers guidance, as well as a skilled and experienced fighter.  The peasant portion of the military are the Warriors. Nevertheless, command is held by the king and the aristocracy, who can seize a battalion at their discretion for any campaign they desire. Some aristocrats may choose to maintain their leadership roles, becoming generals. The aristocratic portion of the military are the Officers.

---

The aristocracy often enjoys proclaiming days of celebration, adding to their tendency to overindulge. They might announce trivial celebrations simply because they desire to, such as marking the anniversary of acquiring a beloved horse. At times, the peasants appreciate these occasions as a break from their labor, while at other times, they resent them due to the work that still needs to be completed. Peasants have their own celebrations, such as harvest festivals and the summer solstice. Additionally, military personnel observe days of remembrance for various campaigns and generals, honoring warriors as well.

---

Aristocratic families typically consist of a male head of the household, his wife and children, as well as his secondary wives and their illegitimate offspring. Only the children of the primary wife are considered legitimate heirs. While males can have multiple wives, the secondary wives and their children are regarded as lower status. The primary wife wears ornate shackles, whereas the secondary wives have polished metal shackles. The primary wife must come from an aristocratic background, while the secondary wives can be of peasant origin.

Peasant males may also have multiple wives, but this is financially more challenging, and all children are regarded as equally legitimate. Due to high mortality rates among peasants, many families are blended or adopt children. It is common for orphaned children to sell their deceased parent's belongings to pay for their adoption into another family. Thus, a peasant family typically includes the male head, his wives—usually just one—and the children, all considered his. The mother’s status is less significant since all children are his, and it is the wives who take care of them, whether they are biological or adopted. Additionally, a remarried woman may have children from her deceased husband. Wives and children can be abandoned, leading them to seek adoption by another family.

Militants can also have multiple wives, and while some high-ranking ones do, they often limit themselves to two. All children, whether biological or adopted, hold equal legitimacy from all his wives. The militant, along with his wives and children, forms the family unit, with the father identifying the mother of his biological children. Any adopted children are taken in by one of his wives, and all wives share the responsibility of caring for all the children, regardless of their biological mother.

---

In an aristocratic family, the father acknowledges only the mother of his legitimate children, while his primary wife is accountable solely for her own offspring. His secondary wives are responsible not only for his illegitimate children but also for the children of the primary wife, as well as any adopted children, if applicable. However, the secondary wives operate under the guidance of the primary wife. The father has the option to legitimize any of his illegitimate children, which then transfers responsibility to the primary wife. He does not have the power to delegitimize.

In peasant families, the mother is not formally identified, but mothers keep track of their own children. In military families, the mother is recognized, and all children are deemed legitimate. Adopted children are regarded as the offspring of one of the wives, and both wives share responsibility for all of his children. Both wives wear fetters of equal status.

---

As an example, consider the following family: Koda is the head of the household, and his wives are Alina, Karina, and Deliah. Jora is Koda’s son.

If Koda were a peasant, the identity of Jora’s mother would not need to be disclosed; only the wives would know who she is.
If Koda were a militant, it would be publicly known which of Alina, Karina, or Deliah is Jora’s mother.
If Koda were an aristocrat and Alina were the primary wife, it would be known if Jora is Alina’s son; otherwise, it would remain unknown, known only to the mother.

---

In an aristocratic family, when the father dies, his primary wife and her children can go to the closest male relatives, such as their father, brother, or uncle. Alternatively, the eldest son may take over the responsibilities. If the son is not of age, his mother, the primary wife, can manage her deceased husband’s estate until he is mature enough to do so. The individual who gains control of the estate has the option to keep the secondary wives and their children. If they are not kept, each secondary wife and her children may seek new marriages. Any illegitimate or adopted children can be taken by the secondary wives, legitimized by the next male relative or eldest son, or seek adoption independently. If the primary wife dies, her children remain legitimate. The father then has the option to elevate a secondary wife (who must come from an aristocratic background) to primary wife, to find a new primary wife, or to remain a widower. If a secondary wife dies, her children can be adopted by their own father or abandoned. The father can decide whether to take another secondary wife or not.

In a peasant family, if the father dies, the eldest son may take over if he is old enough. If not, each wife will take her children and any adopted ones with them, seeking to remarry along with their children. However, the most common practice is for either the eldest son or each wife to have their members adopted separately into different families, as adopting an entire family would be too burdensome for most. If any of the wives die, the father may choose to remarry or not, and children can be abandoned to ease the burden.

In militant families, when the father passes away, either the eldest son (if mature enough) or the two wives take control of the family and the estate. The two wives can decide to stay together or separate, remarry together or individually, or remain widowed. If one wife dies, the father may choose to remain a widower or find a new wife, with the children of the deceased wife going to the new one.

---

On one occasion, a peasant family consisting of nine members faced tragedy. The father, his wife, and their seven children, including a newborn, suffered greatly when the father died in a construction accident. The eldest son, Limarl, took charge of the family, but their mother was also ill and soon passed away. Limarl struggled to support the family, leading him to sell all their belongings. He purchased a cart and an animal to pull it, while the room they lived in was used as payment for the newborn sibling. Limarl then divided the money he had into four parts for his four youngest siblings. They traveled from town to town, seeking peasant families willing to adopt each of the four youngest. Eventually, only he and his eldest sister, Sania, remained. Limarl planned to sell the cart and the animal, intending to split the proceeds with Sania. However, he ultimately chose to give all the money to her so she could be adopted by an aristocratic family. Limarl then continued on his journey and was eventually adopted by a military family.

---

Children of peasants have access to the same opportunities as other peasants, including labor, service, and domestic work. Males may pursue careers as soldiers, while females are encouraged to marry at a young age and to remarry quickly if they become widowed. They are advised to always seek the protection of a male figure, whether it be their father, husband, or son. Unmarried and widowed women still exist, but they face difficulties, making it more challenging for them to remain in that situation.

---

In militant families, militants are divided into two groups: Warriors and Officers. Warriors are essentially from the peasant class, as they are recruited from the peasant population. Officers are members of the aristocracy. Children in militant families can choose to enlist or pursue opportunities suited to their social class, with peasant opportunities for warriors and aristocratic opportunities for officers. Daughters are often encouraged to find militant husbands, especially from the officer class, rather than marry peasants. However, they may also choose to remain with their mothers. It is not uncommon for unmarried and widowed women to exist, and depending on the honor associated with their father or deceased husband, it may even be regarded as honorable to remain single. Staying unmarried or widowed is often seen as preferable, as it maintains a connection to a father or late husband of high honor, rather than marrying or remarrying someone of lesser Honor. Daughters receive a modest dowry.

---

Children of aristocrats are categorized according to their ancestry. Those born to a primary wife, who comes from an aristocratic background, are considered legitimate and can aspire to any aristocratic role, including positions in administration, governance, property ownership, the military, and higher education. They also have full rights to their father’s estate, which may be divided based on the father’s preference, age order, or with the eldest son receiving a larger portion. Daughters are entitled to a dowry, with the eldest daughter potentially receiving a greater amount.

In contrast, children born to secondary wives with aristocratic lineage are deemed illegitimate; they have similar job prospects but cannot claim their father’s estate unless there are no legitimate heirs. Their daughters receive a smaller dowry. If the mother is a peasant and if they legitimized by the father, those children can claim their father’s estate, and daughters will receive a dowry. However, they cannot pursue any aristocratic roles beyond what their father held; for instance, if the father was an administrator, that is the only position they can aim for. Otherwise, they revert to peasant status. It is common for them to serve as servants to aristocrats.

Children whose mothers are peasants and are secondary wives are illegitimate and lack aristocratic opportunities, often remaining as servants. Daughters in this situation do not receive a dowry. Returning to the peasant community, however, having an aristocratic father may afford them some level of prestige.

Lor society operates under a patriarchal structure featuring three primary castes: Peasants, Militants, and Aristocrats. The Peasants are the most numerous, ranging from humble farmers to influential merchants. However, those born as Peasants remain in that status for their entire lives. The Aristocrats form the ruling class, enjoying a life of luxury and owning all resources. Lineage is of utmost importance; even a poor aristocrat wields more power than a wealthy peasant merchant. Aristocrats are born into their class and remain there throughout their lives.

The Militants are divided into the Warrior Corps and the Officer Corps, with the Warrior Corps made up of Peasants and the Officer Corps consisting of Aristocrats. Their offspring are born into either the Peasant or Aristocrat caste, respectively. Warriors are never able to rise to the rank of Officers. The militant class enjoys various privileges that depend on their honor.

---

In the militant caste, Warriors enjoy greater privileges compared to their peasant counterparts. The most effective officers understand the importance of reducing the gap between Warriors and Officers, striving to treat them as equals whenever possible. However, the majority of officers do not follow this principle and openly display their superiority over the Warriors.
Numerous aristocrats join the militant caste primarily for the additional benefits that come with the honor. As long as the unit they are part of achieves success, they gain honor — even if their personal contribution to that success is minimal.

---

Peasants remain peasants, while aristocrats remain aristocrats. Even a poor aristocrat possesses more privileges than a wealthy peasant. For women, the highest position they can attain is being a secondary wife to an aristocrat. However, they are not considered aristocrats themselves, and their children are born as peasants. Their privileges depend on what their aristocratic husband permits.

For a male born as a peasant, if he is legitimized by his aristocratic father and successfully claims his father’s estate, he can then have a primary wife who is an aristocratic woman, and his children will be born as aristocrats. Even if a peasant-born male is legitimized, claims his inheritance, and holds his father’s position, he is still considered a peasant at heart. If he makes a mistake, he risks losing everything and potentially damaging his father’s lineage in the process. This is the sole way for a peasant-born individual to have children who are aristocrats.

In the military, the officer ranks are composed entirely of aristocrats, while the warrior ranks consist of peasants. Being part of the military class provides greater privileges than being a peasant, but one can still be discharged in disgrace. Officers retain their aristocratic status even if they are dishonored, although they will no longer enjoy the extra privileges that come with being part of the military class.

---

The militant class serves as their professional military force. They engage in training, marching, and sparring on a regular basis, but it is through combat that they gain the most experience. This class includes the peasant Warrior Corps and the aristocratic Officer Corps. The Warrior Corps is made up of basic foot Soldiers who constitute the majority of the army. A seasoned Soldier may advance to the rank of Corporal. An esteemed Corporal can rise to the rank of Knight, which is the highest position within the Warrior ranks. They take on sub-command duties

The Officer Corps comprises Captains, Commanders, and Generals, with Captains responsible for promoting Warriors. The King and his Nobles are the ones who promote the Officers. In terms of military units, they have basic infantry, cavalry, archers, and artillery. Additionally, there is the Royal Guard, made up solely of Knights.

The kingdoms of Lor are extensive and plentiful. Although an individual town or even a kingdom might concentrate on a specific economic product, the overall Lor economy encompasses all sectors. There is, however, one exception: they are not seafaring. Consequently, they lack a maritime presence and rely on others for access to marine resources.

The territories governed by the Lor are vast. Many kingdoms are located near volcanoes, although this is not universally the case. These lands range from forests to deserts and open plains. However, there are two types of regions the Lor do not control: cold climates and areas abundant in water, such as humid regions, coastal zones, or any locations near water. They struggle to thrive in excessively cold conditions or in places with significant water presence. Instead, they favor warmer and even drier environments. They still need water, they have territories with rivers, just not excessive water by their standards, like lakes.

---

With a wide range of land, they possess various resources. These include timber, stone, metals, gems, precious metals, livestock, and farms. They generate a surplus that is available for export. However, some of the few things they lack are fish and marine products, as well as water navigation and transport. In certain areas, they must import water, not due to scarcity, but because it is too dangerous for them to access. Additionally, there are some types of stone, metals, and wood that are not found in their regions. One intriguing agricultural method is lava farming. They have high heat resistance, so they are able to touch lava. They have discovered how to make specific crops fire-resistant, allowing them to grow on lava pools. allowing them to populate volcanoes, even calderas. One water source they enjoy are from hot springs.

---

The Lor maintain a range of relationships with various races and other Lor kingdoms, including war, peace, alliances, isolation, and open trade. Throughout much of their history, they have been expansionist, seizing land from others. Currently, many bordering kingdoms are mixed, favoring coexistence. However, inland kingdoms continue to pursue expansion, sometimes engaging in conflict with other Lor kingdoms.

A notable alliance exists with the Dis Com people in their territories, who, in return for land for their forts, they will respond to any Call to Arms from the Lor. The Dis Com are known for having one of the strongest militaries; only the most incompetent general would consider sending troops against them, and soldiers would rather refuse such an order than fight the Dis Com.

There are also a few desert kingdoms that have trade agreements with the desert Frills, who mine water and metals for the Lor in exchange for crops. Additionally, the Lor export lava to the underwater race Ma Hir in return for marine products. Kingdoms near the hospitable Redn nation — whether Lor or not — trade protection for Redn crops, even against other Lor kingdoms.

The Aria and the Murai, two other expansionist races, are common adversaries of the Lor, frequently conquering, losing, and reclaiming each other’s territories. It is not unusual for the Lor to hold prejudiced views toward them.

---

Numerous border kingdoms are diverse, comprising various races. Some are still governed by the Lor, while others have a blend of leadership. These kingdoms serve as centers of cultural exchange, both influencing and being influenced by Lor culture. Furthermore, any territories the Lor have relinquished still retain some elements of Lor culture from the time of their occupation.

Lor art is diverse, though not considered the finest available — other races create superior art. Nevertheless, peasants, militants, and aristocrats each utilize art in distinct ways. An intriguing example can be seen in marriage fetters. Peasants are quite practical, typically using wood and rope, while more affluent peasants opt for cast metal fetters. However, their designs usually feature simple decorative patterns.

Militants, on the other hand, use metal for their fetters. Warriors polish their own, while Officers have theirs polished by artisans. These fetters are adorned with symbols of their husbands’ honors, and some Officers embellish them with precious metals to accentuate certain accolades. Aristocrats possess elaborate fetters made from polished or precious metals, often embellished with gems and decorative trims. Their chains are also more intricate. The most esteemed material is Azure metal, which resembles gold but has a blue tint, and is worn by nobles and the king.

---

Magic exists, Eura manipulation, but it remains largely unknown and plays only a minimal role in Lor society. The Lor are beings created from Fire and possess an innate ability to control it Fire Eura, although they are mostly unaware of this talent. Occasionally, someone uncovers this skill, but the lack of understanding and the inability to study it prevent them from teaching it to others.

One notable application, however, is in healing. Lor medicine is quite inadequate. Much like fire itself, the Lor can easily cause harm but struggle with the process of healing. Lor medics are of poor quality, to the extent that they often prefer to bring in medics from other races rather than rely on their own. Yet, from time to time, an individual who has discovered fire eura usage and dedicated considerable time to mastering it uncovers the remarkable healing properties of fire. They refer to this healing fire as the “white glow.”

This technique surpasses even the most skilled medical teams, and these healers travel to offer their services. Many attract devoted followers, while others dismiss them as frauds, claiming there’s no way broken bones could heal magically. By the time these healers have perfected the white glow, they are often approaching old age, leaving them with little time or opportunity to train a successor. Furthermore, they typically spend no more than ten years practicing before they pass away.

[META NOTE] These healers are regarded similarly to messianic figures like Jesus, with their sudden appearances and subsequent disappearances. This leads to tales about past healers who once roamed the land, particularly from their followers, who may insist that these great healers will one day return. This belief may eventually prove true, as someone else may rediscover how to wield the white glow.

---

Their beliefs are highly diverse. Some are made up of small sects, while others span multiple kingdoms that worship a single deity, twin deities, or numerous deities. Some of these practices are still alive today, while others have diminished or become isolated. In certain kingdoms, the laws are based on their religious beliefs, whereas in others, religion and governance function separately.

A recurring theme in kingdoms situated near volcanoes is the presence of beliefs linked to those volcanoes. They are perceived as the deity itself, the home of the deity, or as a consequence of the deity’s actions. In one instance, the local volcano is viewed as the final place where the deity stood before leaving. In another, the eruptions are seen as the deity’s attempts to escape. In a kingdom with three volcanoes, there are legends suggesting that the volcanoes themselves are the deities protecting the people.

Each kingdom and region possesses its own stories, but these accounts lack cohesion. There are many variations of the tales about the great healer. Local folklore features different heroes and significant figures. One well-known story involves a gladiator facing off against a king. Another commonly recounted tale explains how the world was formed from a volcanic eruption, with the specific volcano changing depending on where the story is told — whether it be a nearby volcano, a fictional one, or the one located in the most powerful of their kingdoms.

The Weapon that the Lor use is the Razor, a three edge blade with the handle embedded in one of its edges. It’s shaped as a three-edged curved triangle. it is defined by its inner edge, outer edge and top edge. The inner edge curves gently inward, forming a concave base where the handle is embedded near one point, close to where the inner edge and outer edge meet. Beneath the handle, a sharp point forms from the junction of the inner and outer edges. The outer edge is the longest, curving outward in a smooth or pronounced convex arc — this is the main cutting edge. The top edge connects the ends, curving inward (concave) in either a sharp or gentle arc, defining two pronounced points where it meets the inner and outer edges — ideal for stabbing or hooking. All edges except the inner edge are sharpened.
