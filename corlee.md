In the World of Threa, there are 21 races. This is a description of a race that lives in the world of Threa, the Corlee. That I will describe

---

The Corle are a matriarchal mercantile people. however, more often than not. they seek dishonest ways to get their coin.

appearance wise, they have canine characteristics. Their skin is covered in fur. The patterns on their fur are inspired by real world dogs, like Labrador, dalmatians and golden retriever to name a few. males can reach a height of 6 feet. females tend to be taller and can reach a height 7.5 feet. They both tend to have muscular builds. They have four fingered hands and four toed feet. They have long floppy ears, and they let their hair grow big.

of note is how the color of their eyes and hair are determined. There are six possible colors either the hair or eyes can be. these six possible colors are split in two categories. Red, Green and Blue form one category, Cyan, magenta and yellow form the other. A child is born with colors that the parents do not have. If the parents have red and green eyes, the child will be born with blue eyes. in contrast, if the parents both have magenta hair, the child may have cyan or yellow hair. If the parents are mixed categories, the possibilities of color expand. The analogous colors are considered. Red with cyan, green and magenta, blue and yellow. for example, if the parents have green and yellow eyes, the child can be born with red or cyan color eyes. hair colors have an additional function. If the child would be born with a RGB color hair, there is a slight chance it may be white instead. similar with CMY children can be born with black hair. If any parent has either black or white hair, their children may have any color from the respective category, minus the standard color of the other parent. for example if one parent has white hair, and the other has red hair. The child may be green or blue. In contrast, if one parent has black hair and the other has red hair, the child may be cyan, magenta or yellow

The Corle themselves don't have a nation of their own. They live among other races. However, there are factions that can exert undue influence in their assumed territories. they may even supplant the local governance with their own.
There are two broad populations. By far the largest are the commoners. They just live their lives just as any other would. the other population is the source of power and corruption. The Corlee Families. the families have establish vast trade networks, sometimes honestly, most of the time not so honestly. The Families use this trade networks to exert their control. they bribe, racketeering, traffic, counterfeit, and facilitate other illicit activities. Each family exerts their protection in their respective networks. they may establish monopolies, granting them complete control of essential supplies for a town or village. they may suplant local governance with their own. either with local figurheads, or a an actual corlee.

The Corlee are a matriarchal kleptocracy. They are stateless. They live within various existing nations, but they maintain their own cultural identity. there are two broad populations, The commoners, and the families. The commoners are by far the largest. They are simply everyday people, living through their lives. following any laws and rules in whatever city or nation they live in. The Families is where power and corruption lie. They form vast trade networks that influence local economies. While there are some honest merchants. a fair number engage in illicit activities, bribe racketeering, arson, extortion, counterfeit, elimination and more. There are multiple roles within the Families, Goons are the muscle, the foot soldiers. The enforcers lead the goons. Regents control various enforcers. The Donna is the head of the family. Mentors advise the Donna. Additionally, there are Covers that help hide and legitimize the families' activities. Covers are not members of the families but may be coerced to participate. then there are fixers, same as goons, but not members of the families, fixers are used to keep some distance with whatever the fixers are tasked to do.

Their weapon of choice is the club. a simple yet remarkably effective weapon that excels in blunt damage. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes. small one for easy concealment. larger one for when they are serious. with the strongest more prestigious Family member wielding exceptionally large clubs, not only for intimidation but to exert the maximum amount of pain and damage.

The Corlee don't produce armor. their clubs have high defensive stats. they depend on debilitating blows, so they shouldn't be hit back. they still have a natural hardiness. however, there is a piece of garment that can function as armor. the Prestigious shawl, worn by elites and high ranking members of the family. notably the Donna. it isn't much, but it further increases their protection. its jet black coloring inspire an air of prestige.

Since the Corle females are the head of the household, the breadwinners. the bosses. They don't take much part in child rearing. their husbands take care of the children and the household. Mothers are father figures and fathers are mother figures.
