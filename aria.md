# Aria

---

In the World of Threa, there are 21 races. This is a description of a race that lives in the world of Threa, the Aria. That I will describe.

---

On their appearance: Of basal form, their skin color ranges across various tints and shades of light pink, lilac, and mauve. Their hair and eye colors are bright purples and magentas. Their hair parts into two points, reminiscent of a jester’s hat or a barn swallow’s tail. Their hair is a bit stiff; female hair has a gentle curve, while male hair has a bend. Their nose is straight and solid. They have flat forearms and hands, with five wide and flat fingers. They have pointed ears. They can naturally levitate. They wear flowy and loose clothing, like sleeveless shirts, belts, wraps, sashes, bell-bottom pants, jester hats, and cloth shoes. They also wear a wide variety of capes. The colors of their clothing range from various pastels, with some vibrant colors for accent. Blacks and darker colors are reserved for military attire. They also wrap their hair in decorative ribbons.

---

The Aria can naturally levitate, though it takes effort — no more than other physical actions. Hovering about a foot off the ground feels as effortless as standing. Gliding at that height is like walking, while moving faster is like running. Gaining altitude feels like walking uphill, and as long as they have stamina, they can keep ascending. They can hold a steady height just like standing still, but if they exhaust themselves, they’ll eventually drop to the ground.

---

The Aria people have vast kingdoms ruled by queens. They are matriarchal, with women present in all aspects of their society, and males are expected to be subservient to females. A quiet husband is a good husband.

---

These kingdoms come in two kinds: those settled on top of mesas — flat-topped mountains — called Highrealms, and those built in the sky from cloud-like materials, called Skyrealms. Both offer strong defenses, since only those who can fly or float can easily reach them. The Aria can forge fluffy but sturdy material that floats, building artificial clouds known as cloudcrete. Highrealms also use cloudcrete, but not as widely, mainly to extend the edges of their mesas. The lands where the shadow of their clouds fall are also claimed as their territory — the Shadowgrounds — whether from the vast Skyrealms or the extended edges of the Highrealms. These areas are the most accessible to other races, whether for trade or invasion.

---

Because their kingdoms are highly inaccessible, they don’t maintain a large military force. Only their Shadowgrounds are vulnerable to external threats. The few military units they have focus on covert operations, surveillance, espionage, sabotage, and assassination. This suits them well, as their bodies don’t easily develop muscular builds, putting them at a disadvantage in direct combat. Their weapon of choice is the boomerang — sharpened, curved metal that can be thrown and returns to the wielder. Their armor consists of hardened capes, designed to preserve mobility.

---

The basic family unit consists of the wife, her husband, and their children. The wife is the head of the household and the breadwinner; the husband is the homemaker. The husband is more involved in raising the children than the wife. Daughters are valued more highly than sons. Daughters carry on the family name, while sons become part of their wife’s family. Firstborn daughters enjoy certain privileges that the other siblings do not, such as inheritance and title priority.

---

There are four main castes. Everyone is born either a noble or a peasant. Peasant females can choose, or be chosen, to advance into the clergy, which includes accountants, administrators, scribes, judges, librarians, medical professionals, bookkeepers, and other specialized roles. They may also enlist or be drafted into the military. Non-noble females can also be abducted into military service. Noble females also enter the military, more often than not in command positions.

---

Males have limited social mobility. They are expected to perform domestic tasks for their household and are mostly unemployed, relying on the breadwinner to provide for them. There are limited employment opportunities outside the home, but they are still expected to maintain their domestic duties.

The father takes care of child-rearing, while the mother’s role is less prominent in daily care. However, it is the mother who is expected to discipline the children. Depending on whether they are born peasant or noble, their experiences — from schooling to available jobs — will differ. The eldest daughter is expected to care for her elderly parents.

---

Female peasants can study and apply to become clergy. Studying is demanding, preparing them for various entrance exams. Each advancement within the clergy is earned after passing a series of tests. They are also subject to regular audits. The clergy effectively serve as the bureaucracy of the nation, handling accounting, bookkeeping, taxation, medical work, judicial duties, and anything that requires maintaining accurate records. The entire caste is fully literate.

These positions, while arduous, come with benefits — including better social standing, improved financial stability, and limited power and influence, especially when serving a noble. If needed, someone can be sent to study for a clergy position, either because the family demands it or because a vacant position needs to be filled.

---

Peasants and clergy can join the military. There are two main branches: Thunders and Zephyrs. Thunder Ops are the lower of the two, handling visible duties such as policing and guarding. They wear uniforms that reflect their role, incorporating black and dark colors alongside light and pastel tones. One may enlist, be recruited, or be drafted into the Thunder Ops.

Zephyr Ops handle covert operations, from surveillance to assassination. They wear no specific uniform, blending seamlessly into the population. Zephyrs are led by a Silence and answer directly to the Queen. All members are abducted. They maintain constant surveillance over the population to identify prospective recruits. They must be absolutely sure the recruit will succeed, as failure means death. Recruits are kidnapped and trained; once they successfully join Zephyr Ops, they are returned to their previous position, which now serves as a front for covert operations. Recruits are usually taken from peasants, clergy, or Thunder Ops; kidnappings from the nobility are extremely rare and must be approved by the Queen. A few males are also kidnapped to join the Zephyrs. An Aria female can choose to enlist directly as a Thunder.

---

The Zephyrs are unknown to the general population. There are, however, rumors of their existence — some true, most false. Many of these rumors are deliberately spread by the Zephyrs themselves. As a result, the Thunders are the only military force visible to the public. Still, most Thunder chiefs are subordinate to a Zephyr, placing the Thunders directly under Zephyr control.

---

Zephyr roles are compartmentalized. Most agents are only aware of the tasks they personally carry out. It’s not uncommon for multiple Zephyrs to be present, surveying the same area, without realizing they are observing another Zephyr. Their reports may even include observations of fellow Zephyrs. Only operators and a select few others know the full picture.

---

There are five main roles that any given Zephyr may have: Murmurs, Rumors, Hushes, Echoes, Whispers, and the Silence.

    Murmurs simply survey their assignments — whether a place, building, or person. They observe and report. They are advised to retreat rather than use lethal force if compromised.

    Rumors are spies. They can perform Murmur tasks, as well as infiltration, interrogation, sabotage, and theft. They may use lethal force if necessary, though it’s best to avoid it when possible.

    Hushes are assassins. They can do everything a Rumor can, but their primary task is to terminate targets. They are free to use lethal force at their discretion.

Murmurs, Rumors, and Hushes are collectively called the Sounds — they are the agents.

    Echoes are couriers. All communications pass through them — reports and assignments between the Sounds and the Whispers. They are only aware of the Sounds they communicate with and their assigned Whisper. Thunder Chiefs are in touch with an Echo to provide reports and receive orders. Sounds are not trained as Echoes, and Echoes are not trained as Sounds.

    Whispers are experts in all fields. They answer directly to the Silence and anyone she may assign them to. Whispers use multiple Echoes to receive reports and issue orders. They make all operational decisions, with only the Silence or the Queen able to overrule them — they are, effectively, the generals of the Aria military. Whispers know the identities of all their Echoes and Sounds. Queens and their Silence employ multiple Whispers to manage operations across different regions.

---

The Silence is the head of the Zephyrs and the unofficial head of the Thunders. She answers to and advises the Queen directly. In public, her role is presented as the head of the Queen’s personal Thunder guard — the official excuse for why she can be present at military meetings with the Queen’s court.

Thunder leadership appears regional. Each governing noble has a Thunder Chief responsible for managing the defense and security of their domain. However, in truth, they are all beholden to the Silence.

---

A Whisper makes the decision to add either a Sound or an Echo. They review reports to identify potential recruits, then assign further surveillance to Murmurs to narrow down the choice. While it’s ultimately at the Whisper’s discretion who they select, they generally prefer individuals showing signs of loyalty and with little or no family ties.

Once a decision is made, a Rumor is sent to kidnap the recruit. An message is also sent to the local Thunder Chief, instructing them to disregard the kidnapping — either by downplaying it or conducting a phony investigation.

The recruit is brought before a Whisper for training as either a Murmur or an Echo. If the recruit cannot be successfully trained, they are terminated to maintain the secrecy of the Zephyrs. Once the recruit officially becomes a Zephyr, they are returned to their previous position, with the local Thunder Chief assisting in the cover-up. They are then assigned to an Echo so they can begin their duties as a Zephyr.

---

At the Silence’s discretion, a Murmur may be advanced to a Rumor, and afterward to a Hush. If the Silence sees potential in a Zephyr to become a Whisper, they are trained in the other role — Sound or Echo — so they master both. Once the Zephyr becomes an expert in both, they can be inducted as a Whisper.

Only after gaining experience as a Whisper, including training new recruits, can they be considered for advancement to Silence. Promotions to Whisper or Silence depend on position availability, which usually opens when an operative retires or perishes.

---

Zephyr progression is entirely driven by the Whispers and the Silence. Whispers select new recruits, while the Silence handles the advancement of Sounds and Echoes. The Zephyrs themselves have no say in the process — they aren’t even aware they’re under consideration. Failure or refusal is not an option, as either leads to termination. The Silence must carefully balance the operational needs of the Zephyr Ops with the wants and considerations of the operatives.

---

A Murmur may not have an active assignment at all — they simply go about their lives. At any time, however, an Echo may issue them a task. Usually, it’s something that doesn’t require much disruption: maybe observing someone who frequents their shop, someone they pass by during the day, or providing a general report on the situation in their area.  
  
Depending on what’s being reported, it might be conveyed by the color of a ribbon they wear that day or which candles are lit. A hallmark of their communication are encoded poems. Messagas, reports, and rders are typically carried in encoded poems
  
However, when time and accuracy matter more than security, an unencoded report may be written. Such sensitive information is either covertly retrieved by the Echo or delivered to a dead drop. The assignment continues until the Murmur is instructed otherwise.

---

An Echo’s work revolves around checking multiple dead drops for messages needing delivery. The sender and recipient details are always coded, unique to that specific Echo. They know exactly how to activate a Sound when required. For high-priority matters, the Whisper either summons the Echo or approaches them directly, and the Echo personally delivers the message to the Sound.

---

At the Silence’s discretion, she may choose a Sound or Echo to ascend to the rank of Whisper. The selection must be made carefully, as a Whisper must master all skill sets—far more than any regular Zephyr. Failure in training results in termination. Whatever skill set the candidate already possesses, they will be trained in the others and expected to gain hands-on experience. Once the Silence is satisfied with their capabilities, the Zephyr is officially inducted as a Whisper under her direct mentorship.

A Silence commands multiple Whispers. These Whispers handle the more tedious tasks: managing Echoes, writing messages, parsing information, and training recruits. They also serve as advisors to both the Silence and the Queen. When a Silence position becomes vacant, one of the Whispers is promoted to fill the role.

A Silence can overrule any Whisper, with only the Queen holding authority above her. Based on the information parsed by the Whispers and their counsel, the Silence is able to make decisions aligned with the Queen’s wishes.

Both Whispers and Silences may accompany any Zephyr on an assignment, usually in a covert capacity. In the case of a Hush mission, they may join openly if necessary. Additionally, they may personally undertake any mission—alone or alongside any Zephyr, including other Whispers and even another Queen's Silence—especially when success is critical, such as in matters concerning the Queen’s life.

---

Males can be recruited as Sounds, though they are mostly assigned as Murmurs. Very few are ever promoted to Rumors or Hushes. Male Echoes are rare and typically handle only low-priority messages, such as surveillance updates and standard reports. They are never elevated to the rank of Whisper.

That said, there are times when a man’s touch is specifically needed for certain missions — such as seduction — where a male Sound can prove more useful than a female operative.

---

Much of the Communication the Echoes carry are Poems. Zephyr Ops encodes messages in poems. to an untrained reader, they appear like surreal poems .
The lines

> Above Goat's Laught
>
> Up the mountain road, the moon whispers
> uproar tic drop silence
> uproar tac drop silence

may appear like nonsense, but to Whisper, it read "Flash Priority, Clear Skies, North from my position, between 11:58am and 12:02pm.
it is a complex cipher of markers, triggers, decoys, coded words and algorithms that Murmurs write their reports with.

---

Thunders are the visible arm of the military, responsible for law and order. There are two main branches: Police and Guards. While many of their duties overlap, Guards primarily handle border security, territorial integrity, and the safety of nobles. Police focus on maintaining order among the populace and enforcing laws.

Depending on the branch, recruits start as either officers (Police) or sentries (Guards). A sergeant oversees four officers or sentries. A captain oversees several sergeants within their branch, and a chief supervises multiple captains from both branches. Chiefs report directly to the local governor — the noble in charge of the region.

Peasant women may enlist to become Thunders, and local authorities or the Queen herself may conscript or draft them as needed. Nobles may enter as well. Commonly as captains or Chiefs. Thunders are exclusively female.

---

Thunders are the visible part of the military. Because of the inaccessibility of Aria territory, it seems to justify their relatively small army compared to other races. Their success in defending Aria lands makes the Thunders appear more impressive than they actually are, since any contributions from the Zephyrs are either unknown or simply credited to the Thunders.

In one historical encounter, an enemy nation attempted to seize an Aria Shadowground. The Thunders prepared to face a much larger invading army. However, the night before the battle, the Zephyrs infiltrated the enemy base. A large deployment of Rumors, Hushes, Whispers, and the Silence covertly entered under cover of darkness. They successfully sabotaged supply chains and armaments, stole enemy plans and communications, planted false intel and fake orders, and assassinated key enemy leaders.

As a result, the next day, the Thunders faced a weakened, disorganized enemy. After the victorious defense, a triumphant celebration was held in honor of the Thunders, proclaiming them heroes and honoring their fallen. Meanwhile, the Zephyrs honored their own victory — and their fallen — in silence, known only to themselves and the Queen. Thunder Chiefs and any Zephyr embedded among the Thunders might suspect Zephyr involvement, but in the moment, they focused solely on their public roles as Thunders, not as covert operatives.

---

From the enemy’s perspective, a successful Zephyr operation is often dismissed as the work of sheer luck — or, as they say, the breeze did it. It was the breeze that blew the intel into the fire, the breeze that dumped the rations into the river, the breeze that took out the general.

While they suspect some covert actions, they assume they were carried out by the Thunders. They blame their own failings for allowing the Thunders — essentially just guards and police — to pull off such operations, never realizing that the Aria have a dedicated covert division. This misunderstanding further boosts the Thunders’ perceived prowess, adding to their reputation and creating a deterrent effect against future invasions.

---

Thunder Chiefs and embedded Zephyrs are used to coordinate with Zephyr operatives, but they always act strictly within their Thunder roles, not openly as Zephyrs. On the battlefield, Zephyr Whispers maintain true control — they are the generals. With the help of Echoes and Thunder Chiefs, they create the illusion that the Chiefs are in command.

Because of the urgency in battle, Echoes cannot operate covertly when delivering messages. They pose as draftees assigned to communicate between Thunder Chiefs, seamlessly injecting Whisper communications into Thunder command.

To clarify: Thunder Chiefs already know the Echo assigned to them, and anything relayed through that Echo is known to the Zephyr Whispers. Normally, the Echo engages covertly with the Chief. However, in battlefield situations, secrecy can’t be maintained, so the Echo operates openly. The Echo and the Chief both know who they really are, but to everyone else, the Echo appears to be just another draftee brought in to support the defensive effort — that’s the cover story used to explain this sudden “new” soldier on the Chief’s staff.

Because of the time-sensitive nature of battlefield communications during an invasion, there’s no time to secure Zephyr channels through complex layers. They rely entirely on the Echo’s skill to maintain operational secrecy.

---

Embedded Zephyrs are Murmurs. They report to the Whispers on the status of Thunder forces and the Thunder Chiefs. During an invasion, they may receive small Zephyr assignments, but it’s understood that in such situations they primarily maintain their Thunder roles, as their units need every available hand. This means embedded Zephyrs may become aware of other Zephyrs present.

For example, if battlefield necessity leads the Zephyr Whispers to use two embedded Thunders for a shared task, those embedded Thunders might begin to suspect the other is also a Zephyr. They are trained to avoid seeking out this knowledge — but, unfortunately, some do. The Whispers may detect changes in behavior; at best, they separate the two operatives and send them far apart. At worst, they terminate both.

A key way to detect if a Zephyr has realized another’s identity is by studying their reports. Whispers often assign basic surveillance tasks, and in those reports, a Murmur might include details about a particular individual. The Whispers already know this individual is a Zephyr, but the Murmur does not — they include them simply because they’re present. However, if in later reports that individual’s presence is consistently left out, it suggests the Murmur has become aware of their true identity and is deliberately reducing mention of them. Cross-checking the reports of the other Zephyrs often reveals the same pattern. If needed, the Whisper may covertly verify this information themselves.

---

The more formidable a Thunder appears, the better it is for the Aria. At times, if deemed feasible, a Thunder may be sent somewhere under the excuse of a vacation or some other harmless reason — while, nearby, a Zephyr operation is underway.

At best, the enemy concludes that the vacationing Thunder somehow caused all the damage the Zephyrs inflicted. They can’t figure out how she pulled it off — but as always, they chalk it up to the breeze. Meanwhile, the vacationing Thunder remains completely unaware that a Zephyr operation even took place, let alone that she’s being credited (or blamed) for its results.

---

The boomerang is the weapon of choice for the Aria. It’s wielded by their military, as well as by some nobles and peasants. Boomerangs can be thrown and will return to the thrower. There are sharpened metal versions and blunt wooden ones.

Boomerangs are usually small enough to be wielded one in each hand, with a few spares attached to the belt. The most common design has a single bend, but other shapes exist — including variants with a second set of bends, as well as ring-shaped, disc-shaped, and cross-shaped models.

Zephyrs typically carry two primary boomerangs and up to four secondaries on their belt. Thunders, on the other hand, wield two secondary boomerangs and one primary. A Thunder’s primary boomerang is unique: it’s large, best used as a two-handed melee weapon rather than a ranged weapon. While it can be thrown, its size reduces its impact when used that way. Because Thunders are the most common users of this variant, these oversized weapons are known as Thunder Booms.

---

Capes are a traditional part of Aria clothing — from peasants to nobles, everyone wears some form of cape. In the military, both Thunders and Zephyrs wear armored capes as part of their gear.

Military capes incorporate metallic components alongside cloth, serving both as armor and a defense boost. Zephyr capes have an inner layer of light metal chainmail, offering only a low defense increase. They prioritize light armor to preserve mobility, and their capes mimic the styles of ordinary civilian capes to maintain their cover. This limits the overall defense they provide, as regular capes aren’t designed for combat and can be too short for full coverage. Murmurs, in particular, use the lightest capes, with a fine wire mesh as the inner layer — offering very minimal protection, just enough to absorb a lucky blow. Zephyrs rely on agility to avoid being hit at all.

Thunders, in contrast, are expected to engage directly in combat. Their capes are larger, long enough to cover most of the body, and made with metal scales for medium defense. The heavy variant uses thicker scales covered in rough cloth for style, providing moderate to high defense. Thunders train specifically to handle these heavier capes effectively, using them as both protection and part of their combat technique.

Cloudcrete is the material used to build the Aria’s Skyrealms. It’s made by combining two key minerals: plumice, a lightweight rock that floats on water, and luffstose, which can form resilient fibers. Both stones are ground down and mixed with water into a slurry. This slurry is then superheated inside a pressurized container. After a set time, the pressure is released, causing the mixture to expand into a fluffy clay known as cloudcrete.

This clay is shaped into construction materials like bricks, mortar, paste, and other components. As it cures, the outer surface forms a fluffy, cloud-like patina, while the inner core hardens into a solid. The fluffy outer layer protects the inner core from unraveling. Interestingly, the thicker the solid core, the fluffier the patina.

Cured cloudcrete is neutrally buoyant in air — meaning it stays suspended, locked in place. It can support up to ten times its own weight before it begins to sink. The uncured clay, however, is not buoyant.

Cloudcrete also mimics the properties of natural clouds: it can absorb water from its surroundings and release it as rain or snow, depending on the temperature. Additionally, under certain conditions, it can generate thunder and lightning.

[Meta note. While plumice is exactly pumice, Luffstose  is based on Asbestos. it is safe as cloudcreat, it is hazardous to mine]

---

While plumice and luffstose can be found in various places, they are typically mined in the Aria’s Shadowgrounds — and that’s how the Aria came to claim those lands.

Before there were Skyrealms and Shadowgrounds, Aria explorers discovered rich deposits of plumice and luffstose in the region. They began manufacturing cloudcrete and gradually built structures above the area. Over time, these cloudcrete constructions grew so massive they cast a permanent shadow over the mines below.

Eventually, the elevated cloud structures became known as the Skyrealm, while the shadowed lands beneath became the Shadowgrounds — both vital to the Aria’s power and territorial control.

---

A few key considerations come with using cloudcrete.

The uncured clay is not buoyant, so it’s preferred to apply it directly at the construction site. Once cured, adjusting its height is cumbersome, though shifting its horizontal placement is much easier. Entire Skyrealm platforms can shift under fierce winds, so they are anchored either to the Shadowgrounds below or to the Highrealm mesas they extend from.

Cloudcrete is also mined and used atop the mountains the Aria inhabit. There, it’s used mainly for aesthetics, since traditional building materials are readily available. It’s also used to extend the edges of mountaintops. Traditional materials like wood and stone are still commonly used alongside cloudcrete.

While cured cloudcrete appears stable, it actually sinks — but at an imperceptible rate. Without maintenance, the fluffy patina erodes, exposing the solid core. When exposed, the core begins unraveling into new patina, gradually reducing buoyancy. Eventually, if left unkempt, it will lose so much lift that it starts falling like a rock.

A properly maintained cloudcrete structure can support up to ten times its own weight before it begins to noticeably sink. The weight of the cloudcrete itself is not part of this calculation — what matters is the additional weight: people, furniture, food, appliances, and anything else not made of cloudcrete.

Traditional materials are often used in Skyrealm construction for aesthetic or practical reasons; sometimes, a wooden or stone structure is simply better suited than a cloudcrete one. These are placed on a cloudcrete foundation or chained to a cloudcrete anchor — essentially a cloud balloon — to offset their weight.

---

The Shadowgrounds reveal the darker side of Aria society. Since the primary value of these lands lies in cloudcrete production, everything else is secondary. The vast majority of the Shadowground population are laborers and miners. Any nobles or clergy present are there solely to support the mining operations — and for them, it’s considered an undesirable, thankless assignment.

The land itself is ravaged by extraction. What little farmland exists yields poorly, sitting under the constant shadow of the Skyrealm. Most of the food is either shipped down from the Skyrealm or Highrealm or imported from neighboring nations, making the population highly dependent on external supply chains.

The military presence in the Shadowgrounds isn’t just there to defend against outside invaders — it’s also there to pacify the local populace. It’s not uncommon for embedded Zephyrs stationed in the mines to defect and join rebel uprisings, having witnessed the brutal unfairness suffered by the people, even as they themselves enjoy a layer of protection due to their Zephyr status.

All of this hardship ultimately serves the populations above — the privileged lives of the Skyrealm and Highrealm. More than one Aria kingdom has fallen because of failures in the Shadowgrounds, whether from mines running dry or from successful rebellions.

Zephyrs in the Shadowgrounds live under the same harsh conditions as everyone else, but their covert status gives them a degree of luxury and protection their peers lack. Unlike many locals who have accepted or resigned themselves to their lot, Zephyrs understand that their situation can be better — and they see clearly how they’re being exploited.

For Zephyr Whispers, managing Shadowground Zephyrs requires special care. A Zephyr presence is necessary for surveillance and protection, given how vulnerable the Shadowgrounds are to outside threats. But there’s always the risk that one might reject the status quo.

For the Whispers and the Silence, the suffering in the Shadowgrounds is viewed as an unavoidable evil. They are sympathetic to the plight of the populace — but they believe that improving conditions would ultimately destabilize everything, causing greater harm for everyone, including themselves.

---

Skyrealm populations live relatively peaceful, sheltered lives — both peasants and nobles alike — but it comes at the expense of the populations in the Shadowgrounds below. Most Skyrealm citizens are largely unaware of the suffering beneath them, as there’s little migration or interaction between the two groups.

To clarify, the various Aria kingdoms fall into two main types: Highrealm kingdoms (built on mesas) and Skyrealm kingdoms (built in the clouds). Both are ruled by queens and both have Shadowgrounds, but their nature differs.

The Highrealm Shadowgrounds are formed by expanding the edges of the mesa using cloudcrete extracted directly from the mesa itself. These Shadowgrounds are populated but not necessarily centered on mining. Instead, they function more like a frontier, with their main population consisting of Thunders stationed in forts, serving as the first line of defense and providing early warnings of potential invasions. Other settlements include small towns and villages. Due to the shadow cast by the cloud extensions, farming is limited, and industries like lumber, cattle, and mining dominate — but cloudcrete production is not a primary focus.

In contrast, Skyrealm Shadowgrounds exist mainly to feed the cloudcrete dependency of the Skyrealm above. This creates a deep divide: the Skyrealm enjoys a near-utopian existence, while its Shadowgrounds are dystopian, burdened by harsh labor and exploitation.

A key distinction between the two kingdom types is their defensibility. Both are difficult to reach, but Skyrealms are significantly harder. Warring nations attacking a Highrealm kingdom can scale the mesa and strike at its population. But for a Skyrealm, the invading army must first conquer the Shadowgrounds below. This spares the Skyrealm population from war’s devastation — until the Shadowgrounds fall.

If the Shadowgrounds successfully repel an invasion, the Skyrealm population may not even realize a war was fought at all. Only when the Shadowgrounds collapse does the Skyrealm population begin to truly suffer the consequences of war.

---

An interesting feature of a fallen Skyrealm kingdom is its lingering defenses. One key defensive strategy was to induce the cloudcrete to generate lightning and thunder, making passage through the Shadowgrounds below extremely dangerous. But after the kingdom fell, no one turned this system off. As a result, the ruined Skyrealm continuously generates violent lightning, battering the lands below.

For travelers and adventurers, this creates a deadly, fascinating zone — a shattered, storm-wracked ruin where constant lightning not only threatens anyone passing underneath but also accelerates the degradation of the cloudcrete itself. Falling debris and sudden strikes make the Shadowgrounds beneath a perilous, unpredictable landscape.

Beyond defense, lightning generation in the Skyrealms has several other uses.

Natural Occurrence: Depending on local temperature, water content, wind strength, and direction, cloudcrete can generate lightning on its own, like a living storm.

Induced Displays: Skyrealm populations can deliberately induce lightning in cloudcrete, mainly for festivities, creating dazzling light shows during celebrations. Some hooligans even exploit it to craft lightning graffiti.

Emergency Use: It can serve as emergency illumination, though there’s always a danger of electrocution if precautions aren’t taken. Floating slightly higher or standing on insulating materials like wood or stone helps reduce the risk.

Of course, while the cloudside festivities are a spectacle, they create a lightning storm in the Shadowgrounds below — turning someone’s celebration into another’s misery.

And in darker moments, the system has been used as a last resort to pacify uprisings in the Shadowgrounds. However, this tactic is rare since widespread lightning is uncomfortable (and potentially damaging) even to the Skyrealm population and their structures.

Female Aria can enter the Clergy, and there’s a whole sub-industry built around preparing them for the demanding entry exam. Unfortunately, some of these prep services are scams, and legitimate preparation can be very expensive. The exam itself carries a hefty fee, and failure bars a candidate from retaking it for an entire year. To make things even tougher, the test format and content are regularly updated.

The exam covers reading, writing, math, history, art, and literature, and requires very high marks to pass. Once admitted, a new clergy member can request an apprenticeship with accountants. After completing the apprenticeship, they become eligible for accountant positions.

Accountants are subject to retesting and audits at varying frequencies, depending on the type of business they’re accounting for. This ensures their skills remain sharp and their work flawless. Failure may result in heavy fines or a temporary ban from the profession, after which they must pass a reentry exam.

From there, accountants can pursue further specializations such as bookkeeping, record keeping, scribing, tax collection, law, judging, librarianship, and medicine. Depending on the path, they will either apprentice under a professional or seek admittance to a specialized school.

With enough experience, they can aim to become an Auditor — the officials who administer exams and conduct audits within their fields. Some attempt to specialize in multiple fields, but this is extremely challenging.

Medical specialization operates differently. Medical trainees attend both school and apprenticeships, and failures in audits or testing lead to retraining rather than fines or professional bans. Aria medical professionals are renowned across the land, and Aria-led hospitals have even been established in foreign nations, strengthening diplomatic ties.

Aria medical personnel wear a distinct uniform: a capeless, salmon-colored ensemble that sets them apart from other clergy.

the clergy. The first entry job in the clergy is basically recording everything for the business. They are not employed by the business, but the state assign them to the business. They make records of relevant actions of the business.

From the initial recorder (Scribe), they then can seek many other field. from those fields (Clerk), they can seek to be an auditor (auditor). From the auditors, does the governong noble chooses their Magistrates. and the court has Ministers . the medical field is different from scribe> Medic >Physician > Minister

Life of a Female Peasant:

A child is born. Depending on the mother’s financial standing, the child’s upbringing can vary greatly.

    A poor-class peasant female may raise the child fully on her own or with a working husband, who helps tend the home and supplements her income with his own small job.

    A low-class female may also marry a working husband who balances household tasks with outside work to help sustain the family.

    A middle-class female often earns enough that her husband can stay home full-time, managing all domestic responsibilities — though he may still choose to pursue additional income.

    A high-class female typically marries a husband entirely dedicated to the household, with no need to work, and they may even hire domestic staff to manage a larger home.

As the child grows older, their opportunities diverge further:

    Poor and low-class children may assist their mothers in their work.

    Low- to middle-class families may send the child to a schoolhouse.

    Middle- and high-class families often hire private tutors.

Both tutors and schoolhouse teachers are drawn from the Clergy Librarians. If a child hopes to join the Clergy, they are best served by starting preparations no later than their teenage years.

Once able-bodied, they officially enter the labor force. At this age, they can also enlist in the Thunders if they choose. For those with particular potential, Zephyrs may begin scouting and kidnapping recruits, especially if the young woman has left her mother’s home to seek work.

    Poor and low-class young women often continue living in their mothers’ households.

    Low- and middle-class women might move to nearby housing.

    Middle- and high-class women may leave their neighborhood entirely for better opportunities.

Over time, they might secure stable jobs, lose work and slip down a class, or land better positions and move up a class. Eventually, they may start courting men and form families of their own.

For poor, low-, and middle-class families, the eldest daughter bears the duty of caring for aging mothers. One day, she herself will be cared for by her own eldest daughter. High-class elderly females, however, can retire comfortably without needing support from their daughters. When they pass away, their husbands and eldest daughters oversee the funeral, cremating the body and scattering the ashes into the wind.

Life of a Male Peasant:

Aria sons are raised similarly to Aria daughters, though within the household, sisters take priority over any male child.

When the boy is old enough, he typically assists his father with domestic chores. Poor, low-, and middle-class families may send sons to the schoolhouse, but their education is generally limited compared to that of daughters.

Once able-bodied, most boys continue with domestic work, either within their birth family or, after marriage, within their wife’s family. Work opportunities outside the home are limited, usually confined to roles like cleaning, cooking, and farming — supporting roles in a society where women hold the primary economic power.

Females may court them, leading to marriage and household duties. If the Zephyrs determine they need a male agent, they may abduct promising young men at this stage of life for training and recruitment.

As men age, they remain tied to the household, taken care of alongside their wives. Upon their passing, it is the wife or eldest daughter who handles the funeral rites, overseeing cremation and the scattering of ashes.

## **Aria Class Breakdown**

* **Poor-Class Peasants**
  Constantly moving from job to job or unemployed, with no stable income.

* **Low-Class Peasants**
  Hold long-term but low-paying jobs, such as mining and farming.

* **Mid-Class Peasants**
  Have decently paying jobs like construction, skilled trades, or modest business roles.

* **High-Class Peasants**
  Hold high-paying roles, such as merchants, traders, or successful entrepreneurs.

* **Clergy**

  * Clerks start at a mid-class equivalent.
  * Advancement through the Clergy ranks raises them to high-class standing.
  * Auditors and Ministers enjoy status on par with **low-ranking nobles**.

* **Nobles**
  Control vast resources and tax the population. They lack for nothing.

  * **Low-tier nobles** own small operations (farms, mines, buildings, businesses) and govern towns; they employ clergy scribes. May also serve as Thunders.
  * **Mid-tier nobles** govern cities, own banks, oversee larger operations, and employ Clerks and Councilers. Some serve in the Queen’s court.
  * **High-tier nobles** They serve directly under The Queen. Some govern the Queen's Provinces. They field Thunder Regiments to defend their territories and The Queen. Others are judges and a few chosen are part of the queens court

* **The Queen**
  Controls everything in her kingdom, including taxing nobles. She directly commands The Zephyrs, thru her Silence, and employs Clergy Auditors and Ministers. She has a large household staff.

---

### **Military & Covert Roles**

* **Thunders**
  Range between mid- and high-class status, depending on rank.

* **Zephyrs**
  Continue living within the class they were taken from but receive a stipend that raises them to at least mid-class.

  * **Zephyr Whispers** and **Silence** enjoy stipends placing them on par with low-ranking nobles, funded by the Queen.

---

### **Domestic Workers (Mostly Male)**

* Receive no direct pay, relying entirely on the household’s income.
* If employed by a mid-class female, they may get a small stipend equivalent to poor-class.
* If employed by high-class or noble households, they may get a stipend similar to low-class.
* For those receiving stipends, their basic needs are covered by the household, so their earnings typically go toward personal wants.

---

### **Royal Family Dynamics**

* **The Queen’s Daughters**
  Receive the finest education in governance, taught by accomplished Clergy Librarians and Scholars, Zephyr Whispers, and Clergy Auditors serving as personal instructors.

* **The Queen’s Sons**
  Are married off at the Queen’s discretion — often for political gain or simply by her command. Sons have little to no say in these arrangements, though some rare queens may show consideration for their sons’ wishes.

* **Queen’s Heirs**
  Daughters are in line for the crown and may also receive ownership of various regions throughout the kingdom. Sons are often married into other noble families or even to daughters of other queens, which carries significant prestige.

Skyrealm Agriculture

Thanks to cloudcrete’s ability to absorb water, mixing it with the right soils allows the Aria to shape cloudcrete structures into farmclouds. These are typically placed at the edges of the Skyrealm, where the cloudcrete is thinnest — this thinness lets some light pass through, enabling limited farming underneath.

Undercloud farming focuses on low-growing crops: vines, tubers, squashes, and similar plants. Tall crops like trees and canes can’t thrive in the shadowed space beneath. More traditional, heavier crops can be grown on the topside of the farmclouds, provided the foundation is reinforced to handle the weight.

Since farmclouds can be suspended at any height, they are often arranged in multi-layered systems — usually no more than three layers, as too many would block sunlight from reaching the lower levels. These farmclouds are crafted just thick enough to support the crops and nothing more. Urban areas also use them for gardens, adding greenery to Skyrealm cities.

An interesting phenomenon occurs when a farmcloud rains — the runoff carries seeds and nutrient-rich soil down into the Shadowgrounds, creating temporary farms below.
Highrealm and Shadowground Farming

Highrealm regions also use farmclouds, but mostly as a supplement to their traditional mesa-based farms.

In the Shadowgrounds, usable farmland is limited due to constant shadow and weak sunlight. The temporary farms formed by seed-laden rains from the Skyrealm or Highrealm above provide short-term boosts to the local food supply, but they are inherently unsustainable. Without constant input from above, these undercloud farms quickly deplete their nutrients, leaving the Shadowground population heavily reliant on imported crops.

The Aria uses the boomerang as their weapon.
the Base is the V shape airfoil with a sharpened edge
Stick is the more common variant; it is the airfoil with a slight bent. It has no edge.
Winged is a W shaped airfoil, it has a further range
Ring is a circular edge. can have an optional bar for a handle. since it has no points, it has no pierce damage.
Disc is a solid circle, the added mass adds blunt damage, and like Ring variant, no edge, no pierce.
Cross has four points, so it has better pierce.
Thunder are large airfoils, they dont fly as far, but are greate in melee combat.

There are a variety of capes made from various textiles. Even lowly peasants wear tattered short capes. The Queen wears a full-length cape with elaborate patterns, made of furs and feathers.

Rather than using armor pieces like cuirasses, vambraces, greaves, or other parts, they rely on armored capes. This is meant to reduce the mobility impact of traditional armor. Even the Feather Steel Cape limits mobility to a level similar to medium armor. One downside is that the cape must be actively used to reduce damage — unlike standard armor, which provides passive protection. Only strikes to the back are passively defended.

Wiremesh Cape Liner: A delicate inner mesh made of fine, tensioned wires. Designed to absorb and nullify a single incoming hit, after which it shatters and becomes useless — a last-resort safeguard. It is hard to see and meant to line existing capes. Used by Zephyr Murmurs and Echoes.

Chainmail Cape Liner: Chainmail that lines existing capes or can be used on its own. Offers decent defense without significantly hindering the wearer’s movement.

Plated Cape: Metal plates layered into a cape. Properly shaped, they can enhance flight.

Feather Steel Cape: Metal plates shaped like thick feathers. Layering these plates improves cape flexibility, counteracting the added weight of the feathers.
