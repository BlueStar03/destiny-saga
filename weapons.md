## Razor

Type: **Razor — Weapon of Choice of the Lor**
Description: The Razor is a three-edged blade with its handle embedded in one of the edges. It is shaped like a curved, three-edged triangle. It is defined by its **inner edge**, **outer edge**, and **top edge**. The inner edge curves gently inward, forming a concave base where the handle is embedded near the bottom point, close to where the inner and outer edges meet. Beneath the handle, a sharp point forms at the junction of the inner and outer edges — the **bottom point**.
The outer edge is the longest, curving outward in a smooth or pronounced convex arc. This is the main cutting edge.
The top edge connects the ends, curving inward (concave) in either a sharp or gentle arc, defining two pronounced points where it meets the inner and outer edges. The **top point** is where the top and outer edges meet; the **inner point** is where the top and inner edges meet.
The outer and top edges are sharpened; the inner edge may be left dull.

| Variant  | Slash | Pierce | Blunt | Reach | Speed | Defense | Wield    | Effects                                                                |
| -------- | ----- | ------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Base     | Good  | Fair   | None  | Fair  | Fair  | Good    | One-Hand | —                                                                      |
| Straight | Fair  | Low    | Low   | Fair  | Fair  | Fair    | One-Hand | —                                                                      |
| Saber    | Good  | Good   | None  | Fair  | Good  | Good    | One-Hand | Stagger on Parry                                                       |
| Rapier   | Fair  | Good   | None  | Good  | Good  | Low     | One-Hand | +Breach Rate; +Breach on Charged Pierce                                |
| Claymore | Good  | Weak   | Fair  | Fair  | Low   | Great   | Two-Hand | Splash on Charged Strike                                               |
| Dagger   | Fair  | Fair   | None  | Low   | Great | Low     | One-Hand | +Speed on Dual Wield; Concealable                                      |
| Honor    | Great | Good   | None  | Good  | Good  | Good    | One-Hand | +Speed and +Defense on Dual Wield; Bleed on Charged Dual Wield; +Bleed |

**Components:** Razorplate, Handle, [Tassel], [Edge Ornaments]

- **Straight:** Cheap to build. It eliminates the top edge; the inner edge is straight. Due to the low production quality, the razorplate stays thick, which increases its mass. It is mass-fielded to armies.
- **Saber:** Enhanced variant. Both inner and outer edges curve in parallel and are the same length; the top edge is short and curves in gently.
- **Rapier:** Fast, with a focus on piercing. The top edge is collapsed. The outer edge is straight, then curves near the handle, then straightens to meet the inner edge, forming a point.
- **Claymore:** Heavy, with a focus on blunt damage. Both inner and outer edges curve inward with the same gentle arc and length. They flare at the end; the handle on the inner edge is longer. The top edge curves outward, allowing mass to concentrate at the top. The edges can have a wider bevel, allowing more mass.
- **Dagger:** Cheap, fast, and suitable for dual wielding. The blade is much shorter. There is no top edge; the inner edge is straight; the outer edge curves back to the inner edge. The handle covers half the inner edge due to the smaller size. Easily concealable. Peasants use this because it serves both as a tool and a weapon.
- **Honor:** A prestigious, dual-wieldable weapon carried by those trusted by the King. The outer edge has a pronounced outward curve. The top edge curves deeply inward, creating sharp points. A **fourth edge** is added, splitting the bottom point in two. The tassel adds flair to each strike. The edge ornaments tell the story of its wielder. Important officers and nobles wield this weapon.

**Concealable:** Can be quickly equipped without needing a weapon sheath, as it fits into pockets, beneath a belt, or in other discreet locations.

| Disc    | Great | None   | Great | Low   | Great | Good  | Good    | One-Hand | Stagger on Block                                                               |
| Cross   | Fair  | Great  | None  | Low   | Great | Good  | Fair    | One-Hand | +Critical Rate                                                                 |

**Components:** Elbow, Wings, [Jewel]

- **Base:** A V-shaped airfoil with a sharp edge.
- **Stick:** Cheap to make, the more common type; a slightly bent airfoil with no sharp edge.
- **Winged:** An enhanced, dual-wieldable boomerang. A W-shaped airfoil that offers longer range.
- **Ring:** A circular, slash-focused variant, sometimes with an optional bar for a handle. Lacking points, it does not deal pierce damage.
- **Disc:** A solid circle whose additional mass enables blunt damage. Like the Ring variant, it has no pierce damage.
- **Cross:** Features four points, providing improved piercing capability.
- **Thunder:** A heavy, large airfoil that doesn’t travel as far but excels in close combat.
- **Zephyr:** A boomerang with a focus on speed. It has two elbows, forming a Z-shaped airfoil. Its purpose is to pummel the opponent to prevent movement.
- **Silence:** A prestigious boomerang. It has two elbows, forming an S-shaped airfoil. It is silent in flight, making it impossible to detect until it hits.

---

**Unblockable:** When hit with this effect, the opponent is forced out of any defensive stance.
**Undetectable:** Will not cause alert, even if seen, until it hits.
**On Stealth:** The user is in a stealth state — crawling, sneaking, hidden, and not yet detected.

## Rifle

Type: **Rifle – Weapon of Choice of the Dis Com**
Description: The rifle is a weapon that balances all three damage types. It is made of two major parts: the **carriage** and the **blade**. The carriage is made of the **guard**, the **grip**, and the **buttstock**. The buttstock provides the blunt-damage surface, the grip helps with maneuvering, and the guard provides defensive capability. The blade is embedded in the guard: it has a long edge for reliable slash damage and ends in a sturdy point for pierce damage.

| Variant  | Slash | Pierce | Blunt     | Reach | Speed | Defense | Wield    | Effects                                                                                             |
| -------- | ----- | ------ | --------- | ----- | ----- | ------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Base     | Good  | Good   | Good      | Good  | Good  | Good    | Two-Hand | —                                                                                                   |

| Shotgun  | Fair  | Fair   | High      | Good  | Fair  | Great   | One-Hand | +Stagger; +Stun; +Stagger on Dual Wield                                                             |
| Sniper   | Good  | High   | Good      | High  | Good  | Great   | Two-Hand | +Critical Rate on Pierce; +Critical Damage; +Breach                                                 |

| Assault  | High  | High   | High      | Good  | Good  | Great   | Two-Hand | +Breach Rate; +Stun Rate; +Bleed Rate; +Critical on Stealth; +Stagger on Block; Speedburst on Parry |

**Components:** Carriage (Guard, Grip, Buttstock), Blade, [Sling]

- **Base Rifle:** The standard design, featuring a blade that curves to a point. Balanced in all aspects.
- **Pistol Rifle:** Easy to produce, fast to use, and dual-wieldable. Essentially just the grip with a minimal guard, no buttstock, and a short blade. Commonly used as a sidearm.
- **Carbine Rifle:** Focused on slash and speed. A shorter version of the rifle that sacrifices reach for faster strikes.
- **Shotgun Rifle:** Focused on blunt damage. A thicker, heavier carriage with a short guard; the blade is mostly embedded in the guard. Can be dual-wielded to gain extra stagger effects on blunt strikes.
- **Sniper Rifle:** Prestigious, with a focus on pierce. Features a longer, sturdier guard to support an extended, more sharply curved blade with a fine tip.
- **Launcher Rifle:** A prestigious heavy weapon. Primarily the heavy carriage, with an extremely heavy buttstock and guard. The thick, heavy blade adds more mass, with only a small edge exposed. Preferred by Juggernauts.
- **Assault Rifle:** The pinnacle of the Dis Com armory. This prestigious weapon excels in close-quarters combat. All damage types have increased proc rates on their effects.

**Sling:** Acts as its own weapon sheath. Enables quick-equip and negates its volume in inventory.

## Spear

Type: **Spear – Weapon of Choice of the Ma Hir**
Description: The spear is a weapon that excels at pierce damage. It is basically a point on a stick. Simple, elegant, rude.

| Variant | Slash | Pierce | Blunt | Reach | Range | Speed | Defense | Wield    | Effects                                                                      |
| ------- | ----- | ------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Base    | Fair  | Good   | Fair  | Great | Good  | Good  | Good    | Two-Hand | —                                                                            |
| Short   | Low   | Fair   | Low   | Fair  | Fair  | Great | Low     | One-Hand | +Critical Rate on Dual Wield                                                 |
| Long    | Fair  | Great  | Fair  | High  | Good  | Fair  | Good    | Two-Hand | +Critical Rate                                                               |
| Heavy   | Weak  | Fair   | Great | Good  | Fair  | Low   | Great   | Two-Hand | Splash on Charge; +Breach Rate                                               |
| Glaive  | Great | Good   | Fair  | Great | Weak  | Fair  | Good    | Two-Hand | Bleed on Charge                                                              |
| Harpoon | Fair  | Good   | Weak  | Great | High  | Good  | Fair    | One-Hand | Recall; Breach on Ranged Strike                                              |
| Halberd | Great | High   | Good  | Great | Low   | Good  | Great   | Two-Hand | +Pierce; +Critical; +Breach; +Bleed; Splash on Charge; Unblockable on Charge |

**Components:** Tip, Shaft, Grip, Butt, [Flag], [Split], [Bottom Tip], [Tether]

- **Base:** Just a spear tip fitted on a shaft. Classic “stab first, ask later.”
- **Short Spear:** Easy to produce, fast to use, and dual-wieldable. A tip on a shorter shaft.
- **Long Spear:** Enhanced, with a focus on reach. A tip on a longer shaft.
- **Heavy Spear:** A heavier variant, like a base spear with a thicker shaft and heavy tip. Helps carry momentum with each thrust.
- **Glaive:** With a focus on slash, the tip becomes a blade.
- **Harpoon:** Built for superior range. Spears are good to throw, but the harpoon goes farther. It has a short shaft but a long, barbed, hooked tip, plus a handy tether to reel in whatever it hit.
- **Halberd:** A prestigious weapon. The tip has multiple points and edges, causing damage with every swing.

### Modular Notes

- **Split Shaft:** Allows the shaft to be split and recombined. The split creates short spears.
- **Bottom Tip:** Replaces the butt with a second tip. Many blunt attacks become pierce or slash.
- If the spear is split and there is **no** second tip, the second weapon is effectively a **Quarter Bo Staff**.
- **Tether** can be added to other spears. If added to anything besides a Harpoon, it applies a **–Speed** penalty.

### Tips (interchangeable heads)

Can be used on Base, Short, Long, Heavy, and as the second tip:

- **Standard:** +Breach
- **Bident:** +Defense
- **Trident:** +Speed
- **Crescent:** +Slash; +Bleed

### Materials

The Ma Hir are an underwater people, so they use both surface and marine materials. Marine materials include **Veridia**, **Theel**, **Hardened Silver**, and **Thecalavium** — all of which sound like metals that hum underwater and judge you for breathing air.

## Blade

Type: **Blade – Weapon of Choice of the Duga**
Description: The Blade shines in slash and speed. It is a leaf-shaped plate affixed to a handle. The long edges of the plate are sharpened and meet in a point. It serves both as a weapon and as a tool for the Duga.

| Variant   | Slash | Pierce | Blunt | Reach | Speed | Defense | Wield    | Effects                                               |

| Anchor    | Great | Good   | High  | Good  | Low   | High    | Two-Hand | Stagger on Block; Knockdown on Parry                  |
| Sharp     | Great | Good   | Low   | Fair  | High  | Fair    | One-Hand | +Slash on Dual Wield; +Defense on Dual Wield          |
| Lost      | Fair  | Low    | Low   | Good  | Fair  | Low     | One-Hand | Forgotten Memories                                    |
| Forgotten | High  | Great  | Great | Good  | High  | Great   | One-Hand | +Speed on Dual Wield; +Breach on Slash; Lost Memories |

**Components:** Plate, Handle, Rivets, [Joint], [Spine Engraving]

- **Base:** Just a plate and a handle. All-around good for slashing very fast.
- **Field:** An inexpensive blade — a thin rectangular plate with one sharp edge. Good for clearing foliage.
- **Shovel:** Less expensive and more useful. A smaller plate on a longer handle, just sharp enough to pierce dirt.
- **Cutter:** Small, cheap, fast, and dual-wieldable. A small handle and a small plate. Good enough to cut fruit (and, incidentally, enemies).
- **Cleaver:** Focused on blunt force. Uses a rectangular plate with only one sharp side. Good for prepping meats or armor that thinks it’s meat.
- **Slicer:** Focused on slash and speed. It has a long, curving plate that’s sharp on one edge.
- **Anchor:** A heavy blade with a thick triangular plate. So thick the handle is affixed inside it. Drive it into the ground and no one can move it.
- **Sharp:** An enhancement of the base — sharper, cleaner, meaner.
- **Lost:** This *false* prestigious blade is the first blade a Duga remembers crafting. It’s nothing special on its own, but it holds potential.
- **Forgotten:** This prestigious blade is a flurry of slashes. It feels powerful, but… it’s like it’s missing something.

- **Joint on the Handle:** Enables blades to be joined at the handles, forming a **double blade**. Dual-wield effects still apply while double-wielding.
- **A Lost Blade** is the first Forgotten Blade a Duga remembers ever making — it’s a **False Forgotten**.
- **Forgotten Memories:** (+++Slash, +++Pierce, +++Blunt, +++Speed, +++Defense) **on Dual Wield with a Forgotten Blade.**
- **Lost Memories:** (+Slash, +Pierce, +Blunt, +Speed, +Defense) **on Double Wield with a Lost Blade.**

**Components:** Shaft, Grip, Caps, [Handle], [Engravings], [Jewel], [Bottom Cap]

- **Base:** A shaft slightly taller than its wielder.
- **Quarter:** An inexpensive staff. The shaft is about shoulder height.
- **Baton:** A cheap, fast, dual-wieldable staff. The short shaft is about forearm length.
- **Long:** With a focus on reach, this tall shaft is about half the wielder’s height again.
- **Pointed:** A pierce-capable staff. One end is sharpened to a point.
- **Pillar:** This heavy staff has presence. It is a base staff but thicker.
- **Flex:** This prestigious staff has a flexible shaft and can hit again on the rebound.
- **Cane:** This prestigious staff is masterfully designed with elegance and strength. Its intricately decorated handle delivers powerful strikes with unwavering force. The shaft, measuring roughly waist-high to the wielder, offers both control and grace in every movement.
- **Kane:** This prestigious staff is masterfully designed with elegance and strength. Its intricately decorated handle delivers powerful...wait. Why does it twist?
- **Spike:** This prestigious staff is a spiked stiletto sheathed inside the Kane.

Additional Rules and Notes

- **Kane** and **Spike** are dual-wielded when unsheathed. No bonus, though.
- **Kane** and **Spike** are crafted together. Compared to a Cane, the material cost for the handle is higher; the material cost for the shaft is lower.
- The **Kane** shaft is hollow; the **Spike** is attached to the handle.
- Since the **Spike** is part of the mass of the **Kane**, it **loses** Blunt when the spike is unsheathed.
- **DoubleHit** causes a second, half-power strike. It can still be blocked if timed.
- The handle can be added to **Base**, **Quarter**, **Long**, **Pointed**, and **Flex**. It is part of **Cane** and **Spike** (**Kane**). It adds **Resist Knockback**.
- The **Pointed** staff has only the bottom cap.
- The bottom cap can be different from the regular caps.

**Caps**

- **Standard:** +Durability
- **Rough:** +Critical Rate
- **Weighted:** +Stun; +Blunt; ––Speed
- **Pointed:** +Breach chance on strike
- **Traction:** Resist Knockdown; +Recovery
- **Hooked:** +Bleed chance on strike
