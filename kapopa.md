---

Their appearance is quite unusual, Their skin is covered in fur-like feathers. it come in a wide variety of pasterns and colors. their eyes come in light blue, green and red-orange colors. they have large, sturdy ears. Their head is crowned in a crest of feathers. this feathers come in a variety of color. one feather on the center is of a different color than the rest. they have a wolf like head with a beak like snout. They have an unusual body structure. They have two torsos. as such, their bodies have three pairs of limbs. The top arms, from their top torso, has muscular arms with five fingered hands. their mid limbs, from their second torso, have four toed paws. this set of limbs are like those of real world lions. Their hind legs, from their hip, have three toed talons. their standard posture is quadrupedal, walking on their hindlegs and mid limbs. they can stand at an average of 5 to 6 feet tall. However, they also can stand upright on their hindlegs. Upright, they double their height at a towering 10 to 12 feet. their mid limbs have limited dexterity and can be used for simple task when standing upright. they also have long tail feathers of the same color as their crest feather.

---

They have a nomadic - hermit like lifestyle. they live deep in the woods. away from just about everything. it is easy to tell if a kapopa lives nearby since there would be wooden statues around. Kapopa are master wood workers. they hone their skill throughout their life.

---

They don't fully isolate themselves. they make their wood working skills to anyone. all they ask is to provide enough for sustenance. no project is to humble for them, but prefer something challenging. that will test their skill, like ornate mansions. additionally, they migrate to different forest so they may experience different kinds of wooden materials.

---

The closest thing to a nation for the Kapopa is a deep forest inland where they make multiple pilgrimages throughout their lives. There is always a temporary Kapopa presence in this forest, with no permanent residents. During these gatherings, they learn from each other, teach, meet fellow Kapopa, and find partners.

---

While females are formidable woodworkers themselves, they follow their husband direction. the husband decides the project, the materials, where to go next, and anything of substance. the wife follows and assist their husbands. their children also follow the fathers direction, until they are partnered. their wedding happens at Deep forest.

---

Kapopa travel all across the lands. Either as a lone male, or with his wife and children. Males children leave their family when they come of age.  females stay with the family until they marry. then they follow their husband. only when widowed, is when they journey alone. They settle in unclaimed land inside a forested area. they build a cabin to live and work. they hunt and gather and produce what they can, They trade for everything else. nearby population may seek them out, when they find that a Kapopa has settled nearby. They will stay for a few years, then pick up and leave. they dismantle their cabin and leave the area pristine, except for a few wooden statues they leave. they may seek another forest, or go for a pilgrimage to Deep Woods.

---

They also have some expertise in metal working, which they use to make their tools. They don't offer their metal working expertise like they do with their woodwork. Thou in turn, they may acquire their tools thru trade rather than making them themselves. From time to time, the need to defend themselves. They don't really carry weapons. But if the need arises, they reach for their tools. In particular, their woodsaws. In a pinch, their woodsaws can be effective weapons.

---

Kapopa are physically formidable. When standing tall, they can tower over any adversary. Years of woodwork and other labor intensive tasks have sculpted their muscular frame. Unless they absolutely have to stand their ground, the prefer to retreat, to flee. They understand that even their magnus opus is not worth risking harm to themselves or their family. Every thing else is replaceable. The only thing the would defend over their family and themselves, is Deep forest. Luckily, the need to defend Deep Forest has never happened, yet

---

They roam the land offering their woodsmith services. It is their skill that organizes their society. Novice, Apprentice, Initiate, Artisan, Expert, Master and grandmaster. Everyone is born a novice since they don't have woodsmithing skills. Apprentice, is when a Kapopa works with an Expert or higher to learn woodsmithing. initiate is someone who completed his apprenticeship and has just started their service. Artisan is someone who has been practicing for some time. Experts are skilled enough to instruct and teach. Masters are highly skilled woodsmiths, with grandmasters being esteemed Masters. both Masters and grandmaster, while not actually having any official power, are highly influential. they also have skills in other fields, mainly metalworks, but also hunting and foraging, it is their woodsmith skill that dictates their rank

Both Males and females hone their skill in woodworking, but it is the males that lead in the creation of their masterworks. they both are also good at metalworks. however, it is a bit less prestigious. with woodwork, they  can seek out their material. can choose a tree, select the lumber, the grain, and control all aspects of the wood the use. with metal, they don't mine, nor smelt metal. they acquire metal ingots thru trade. while their is a certain finesse in ingot selection, they are going of from someone else work.  
with textile work, it is the females domain. the males can still craft with textile. they tend to keep one or two woolen animals for some textile production, but need to trade for other fibers, thou they do their own looming. they also do leatherworks, but just like metal, they don skin nor tan their hides, they get all their leather and pelts thru trade. and while they can do stonework, they avoided. they don't feel comfortable carving stone.
