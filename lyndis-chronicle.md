## **Act 1: Start of Rounds - Action Tutorial (Hidden Quick Action)**

- **Scene Setup**: The screen fades in from white, panning down to reveal the area in front of the head nurse's office in a hospital.
- **Narrative**: Lannet startles Lyndi, causing her to drop her clipboard. Lannet picks it up and hands it back to Lyndi.
- **Prompt**: After Lannet picks the clipboard and begins handing it back to Lyndi, "Here, take it."
- **Action**: The player is to press the action button to grab the clipboard.
- **Struggle**: If no action is taken, Lannet prompts: "Press the action button and take it."
- **Fail**: If Lyndi doesn’t grab the clipboard, Lannet shoves it into Lyndi's hands.
- **Hidden Tutorial**: Before Lyndi is startled, a quick action prompt appears. If pressed in time, Lyndi retains her composure instead of dropping the clipboard.
- **Hidden Element**: This is actually a hidden quick reaction tutorial. As soon as the scene fades in, Lannet approaches Lyndi from behind, startling her, which causes the clipboard to fall. The quick reaction prompt allows players to prevent the clipboard from dropping.
- **Impact on Lannet**
  - **Increase Frustration**: Lyndi being startled (failing the quick action). Lannet shoving the clipboard into Lyndi's hands (failing the action tutorial).
  - **Increase Respect**: Lyndi retaining her composure (quick action success).

## **Act 2: Walk to the First Room - Walk Tutorial**

- **Narrative**: Lannet tells Lyndi to follow her. They both walk to the first room.
- **Prompt**: "Follow me"
- **Action**: Use control stick to move Lyndi and follow Lannet.
- **Struggle**: "Tilt the left joystick and follow me."
- **Fail**: Lannet grabs Lyndi's hand and drags her to the first room.
- Impact on Lannet:
  - Increase Frustration: Lannet having to drag Lyndi to the first room (Fail walk tutorial)

## **Act 3: Clean the Room - Action Tutorial**

- **Narrative**: Lyndi and Lannet enter a room with eight empty beds. Lannet cleans the four on the left, and Lyndi does the same to the ones on the right. They take the charts, and pick up and place the pillows on the beds.
- **Prompt**: "I'll take the four on the left, you take care of the four beds on the right."
- **Action**: Pressing the action button will pick up and place the pillows; long press to take the charts.
- **Struggle**: When Lannet has finished two of her beds and Lyndi has not finished half of her tasks: "Press the action button to grab and place things. Long press to pick up the charts."
- **Fail**: Some moments after Lannet finishes her task, she will finish whatever remains on Lyndi's side.
- **Impact on Lannet:**
  - **Increase Frustration**: Each bed on the right side of the room that Lannet had to finish
  - **Increase Respect**: not triggering struggle state 

## **Act 4: Mr. Kendri - Dialogue Tutorial**

- **Narrative**: Lyndi and Lannet go to the next room. There are four patients, two on the left, two on the right. Lannet tells Lyndi to take care of the two on the right, while she takes care of the other two. One of Lyndi's patients is sleeping, and all that is needed is to update the chart. The other patient is Mr. Kendri. Lyndi and Mr. Kendri exchange pleasantries, and Lyndi makes sure he is taken care of. Once they are both done, Lyndi and Lannet leave the room.
- **Prompt**: "I'll handle the left side, you take care of the rest."
- **Action**: Pressing the dialogue button near Mr. Kendri will initiate a conversation.
- **Struggle**: If Lyndi has not spoken to Mr. Kendri when Lannet has finished with her first patient: "Press the dialogue button to talk to your patients. Hold it to think carefully on how you speak to them."
- **Fail**: Some moments after Lannet finishes her side, she will finish whatever is left. If Lyndi is still talking with Mr. Kendri, Lannet will interrupt and politely end the conversation.
- **Additional**: If Lyndi checks Mr. Kendri's chart before speaking to him, he will initiate the conversation. Lyndi may also wake up the other patient, but he will be annoyed.
- **Impact on Lannet**:
  - **Increase Frustration**: Each bed on Lyndi's side that Lannet has to complete. If the conversation with Mr. Kendri takes too long and Lannet has to interrupt it. If Lyndi wakes up the sleeping patient.
  - **Decrease Frustration**: If Lyndi doesn't trigger the struggle state.
  - **Increase Respect**: Not triggering struggle state. Having a conversation with Mr. Kendri beyond the minimum "How are you feeling" without taking too long for Lannet to interrupt it. Talking to Mr. Kendri before checking his chart

## **Act 5: The Ward - Practice**

- **Narrative**: Lannet and Lyndi arrive at the ward, a large open room with 60 beds, organized in 4 rows of 15. Not all beds are occupied. There are two veteran nurses present. They instruct Lannet and Lyndi to help them check the patients.
  - **Row Selection**: There are two center rows and two outer rows.
    - If Lyndi picks a center row, Lannet will pick the other center row.
    - If Lyndi picks an outer row, Lannet will pick the closest center row.
    - If Lannet has to pick first, it depends on which veteran nurse is closest to Lyndi:
      - If Lyndi is closest to the warm nurse, Lannet will pick one on the left side (either outer left or center left). Otherwise, she will pick one of the right rows.
      - If Lannet’s frustration is low, she will go to the row with the most patients on the chosen side. Otherwise, she will go to the one with the least patients.
    - For the veteran nurses:
      - Whichever nurse is closest to Lyndi will pick the closest row that aligns with their trait.
      - The warm nurse will pick the row closest to Lyndi, and the focus nurse will pick the row closest to Lannet.
      - The remaining veteran nurse will take the last row.
- **Prompt**: "So you are the two new nurses helping with rounds today. You two can check one row."
- **Action**: Check charts and talk to patients. They may have requests that Lyndi can choose to fulfill or not.
- **Struggle**: When Lannet has passed her fifth bed and Lyndi hasn't reached her fifth bed, if Lannet is in an adjacent row: "Just check the charts and check the patients, keep things moving." If Lannet is not in an adjacent row, there will be no struggle.
- **Fail**: Moments after Lannet finishes her row, she will go to Lyndi's row and finish whatever is left.
- **Additional**: Patients may have requests, such as getting water or telling a joke. Lyndi can choose to comply or refuse.
- **Veteran Nurses**:
  - At the end, the veteran nurses notice the dynamic between Lannet and Lyndi, similar to what the director sees. One nurse will comment on focus, and the other will comment on warmth.
  - Whichever nurse finishes her row first will make the comment. Both nurses are faster than Lannet, but their rows’ difficulty determines which one finishes first.
  - If Lannet has to do one bed on Lyndi's row, the veteran nurse that finishes first will comment on Lannet:
    - **Focus on Lannet**:
      - **Neutral**: "You're focused. Lyndi can learn something from you."
      - **High Frustration**: "You're pushing hard, but you need to watch your stress levels, Lannet."
      - **High Respect**: "You always give it your best, Lannet. Your focus never falters."
    - **Warmth on Lannet**:
      - **Neutral**: "Your touch is a bit cold. You need to warm up to your patients."
      - **High Frustration**: "You're efficient, but it's showing in your demeanor. Patients can sense your stress."
      - **High Respect** (Subtle): "You handled things well today, but remember that a little warmth goes a long way."
  - If Lannet doesn't have to finish any of Lyndi's row, the veteran nurse will comment on Lyndi:
    - **Focus on Lyndi**: "Your focus is spot on. You two make a great team."
    - **Warmth on Lyndi**: "Your smile brings warmth to your patients."
- **Impact on Lannet**:
  - **Increase Frustration**: Every bed Lannet has to finish in Lyndi's row.
  - **Decrease Frustration**: Not triggering the struggle state.
  - **Increase Respect**: Fulfilling additional tasks and requests from the patients, finishing her row.

## **Act 6: Going Upstairs - Hidden Subtle Dialogue Tutorial**

- **Narrative**: After the ward, Lyndi and Lannet head to the stairwell and proceed up to the second floor.
- **Hidden Element**: During the ascent, a subtle dialogue prompt appears, indicating that Lyndi has something to say. Holding the dialogue button to bring up the ring menu is the only way to engage in this conversation.
  - **Conversation Start**: Lyndi asks, "Lannet, why aren't we friends?" Lannet replies with, "What are you talking about?"

- **Replies**
  - **Frustrated Replies**
    1. "You always push me away, even when I try to help."
    2. "You never let anyone in, do you?"
    3. "Why do you have to be so difficult?"
    4. "We could have been close if you'd just let your guard down."
  
  - **Somber Replies**
    1. "I thought after nursing school, we'd at least be close."
    2. "We went through all the same training, but we still feel distant."
    3. "I guess some things just never change, right?"
    4. "Do you ever wonder what it would be like if we were actually friends?"

  - **Reflective Replies**
    1. "Remember our first year? I always admired how focused you were."
    2. "I learned a lot from watching you. You were always so determined."
    3. "Sometimes I wonder if I could be as dedicated as you are."
    4. "Maybe we just have different ways of caring, but I think we make a good team."

  - **Frustrated**
    1. Lannet looks intensely at Lyndi for a moment.
    2. Lannet says, "Shut up."

    2. Lannet says, "Stay focused."
    3. Lannet says, "Don't worry yourself."
    4. Lannet stops, crosses her arms, and remains silent for a moment, then resumes walking.

    3. Lannet closes her eyes for a moment.
    4. Lannet stops, hands at her sides, looks down for a bit, then looks up and closes her eyes, remaining silent before resuming walking.

- **End of Conversation**: Upon exiting the stairwell, regardless of the current state, Lannet pauses and says, "Focus, we still have work to do," and the conversation ends.

- **Impact on Lannet**
  - **Not having the conversation** decreases frustration.
  - **Frustrating options** add to her frustration.
  - **Somber options** decrease her frustration.
  - **Reflective options** increase her respect.

## **Act 6: Going Upstairs - Hidden Subtle Dialogue Tutorial**

- **Narrative**: After the ward, Lyndi and Lannet head to the stairwell and proceed up to the second floor.
- **Hidden Element**: During the ascent, a subtle dialogue prompt appears, indicating that Lyndi has something to say. Holding the dialogue button to bring up the ring menu is the only way to engage in this conversation.
  - **Conversation Start**: Lyndi asks, "Lannet, why aren't we friends?" Lannet replies with, "What are you talking about?"
  - **Replies**:
    - **Frustration Replies**:
      1. "You never share anything about yourself. It’s like you’re always in a rush to get the job done."
      2. "Back at school, you always kept to yourself. It felt like you didn’t care about anyone else."
      3. "You’re always so cold to me and everyone else. Do you even care about your patients?"
      4. "It’s hard to work with someone who never wants to get along, Lannet."
    - **Somber Replies**:
      1. "We've been through a lot together, Lannet. I thought we’d be closer by now."
      2. "At the hospital, it just feels like there's a distance between us, and I don’t know why."
      3. "I’ve tried to get to know you since we started nursing school, but it’s like there's a wall."
      4. "I sometimes wonder if I did something wrong, or if you just don’t like me."
    - **Reflective Replies**:
      1. "I remember how focused you were during training. I always admired that, but I wish we could have bonded more."
      2. "We both went through the same challenges in nursing school. I thought that would bring us closer."
      3. "You’re incredibly good at what you do. I just wish we could connect beyond the tasks we do here."
      4. "Maybe I haven’t made enough of an effort. But I want to understand you better, Lannet."
  
  - **Lannet's Reactions**:
    - **Frustration**:
      1. Lannet looks intensely at Lyndi for a moment.
      2. Lannet says, "Shut up."
      3. Lannet says, "Stop being nosy."
      4. Lannet stops, her right hand balls into a fist and shakes for a moment. She then remains silent before resuming walking.
    - **Somber**:
      1. Lannet looks down.
      2. Lannet says, "Stay focused."
      3. Lannet says, "Don't worry yourself."
      4. Lannet stops, crosses her arms, and remains silent for a moment, then resumes walking.
    - **Reflective**:
      1. Lannet takes a deep breath.
      2. Lannet says, "I..."
      3. Lannet closes her eyes for a moment.
      4. Lannet stops, hands at her sides, and looks down briefly before looking up and closing her eyes. She then resumes walking.

- **Outcome**: Lannet continues to ascend the stairwell, and as soon as she exits, she immediately ends the conversation by saying, "Focus, we still have work to do."
- **Conversation Mechanics**:
  - Normally, pressing the dialogue button will cause Lyndi to issue a greeting: "Hey Lannet," which Lannet always dismisses with "Not now," ending the conversation. Players can always do this, and each attempt increases Lannet's frustration.
  - If the player tries to pull up the dialogue ring menu without a subtle dialogue prompt, it will just show the greeting dialogue and nothing else.
  - In the stairwell, when the subtle dialogue prompt appears, the ring menu will have "Lannet, why aren't we friends?" as an option. Selecting this starts the conversation.
  - After Lannet says, "What are you talking about?" the ring menu will show three of the replies, one of each category. Selecting one will prompt Lannet's response.
  - Each time the ring menu is pulled up, a different set of three replies are shown. The dialogue button must be held for some time to bring up the ring menu, consuming time during the limited duration of the stairwell scene.
  - Pressing the dialogue button without pulling up the ring menu will cause Lyndi to stutter, stopping Lannet for a moment as she responds, "What?" This increases Lannet's frustration.
  - The ring menu also has the option to end the conversation, with Lyndi replying, "Never mind," which decreases frustration.
  - Once outside the stairwell, after Lannet says, "Focus, we still have work to do," the interaction behaves as it did before, with Lyndi saying, "Hey Lannet" and Lannet replying, "Not now," dropping the conversation. The ring menu no longer shows additional options.

- **Impact on Lannet**:
  - **Increase Frustration**: Engaging in the frustrating dialogue options or stuttering during the conversation.
  - **Decrease Frustration**: Not having the conversation, choosing somber dialogue options, or ending the conversation with "Never mind."
  - **Increase Respect**: Choosing reflective dialogue options.

## **Act 7: Private Rooms - Advanced Tutorial**

- **Narrative**: Lyndi and Lannet arrive at a hall on the second floor, with three doors on the left and three on the right. These lead to private rooms reserved for important individuals. Lannet takes the three on the right, while Lyndi takes the three on the left.
- **Prompt**: "You will check on Mr. Roth, Ms. Liya, and Mr. Gregor on the left."
- **Action**: Update each chart, ask about each patient's well-being, and complete one task to enhance their comfort.
- **Interaction Options**: The initial interaction with each patient changes based on whether Lyndi just opens the door, knocks, or knocks and announces herself. In addition to long pressing, pulling up the respective ring menu will also give the option to knock (action ring menu) or announce herself (dialogue ring menu).
- **Struggle**: Before Lannet enters her first room, if Lyndi simply opens the door to her first room (by pressing the action button), Lannet will say, "Long press the action to knock at the door and long press the dialogue button to announce yourself next time." Lannet will enter her first room in such a manner, cluing the player on how to do it properly if they wait for Lannet to go first. Once Lannet enters her room, or if Lyndi knocks and announces herself, there will be no struggle.
- **Fail**: Once Lannet finishes with her three rooms, she will complete any mandatory tasks that have not been completed in Lyndi's rooms.
- **Lannet's Speed**: Lannet's speed in completing her tasks is different depending on how the stairwell conversation went:
  - **Mostly Frustrating Replies**: Fastest speed.
  - **No Engagement or "Never Mind" Without Issuing Other Replies**: Normal speed.
  - **Mostly Somber Replies**: Slower speed.
  - **Mostly Reflective Replies**: Slowest speed.
- **Patient Order**: Patients can be tended to in any order.

**Sub-Acts:**

- **Act 7.3b: Mr. Gregor (Passes Away)**



### **Act 7.1: Mr. Roth**

- **Narrative**: Mr. Roth is a wealthy donor to the hospital. There isn't really anything wrong with him; he's just taking a "vacation" to get away from it all. He is happy and cheerful. There are various tasks, requests, and dialogue options that can be completed. The bare minimum is to check his chart and ask if he is feeling well. Everything else is optional.

**Initial Interaction Responses**:

- **Barges In**: Mr. Roth raises an eyebrow and says, "Well, that was quite an entrance, Nurse. Ever heard of knocking?"
- **Knocks Only**: Mr. Roth looks up and says, "Ah, come in, Nurse. No need to be shy."
- **Announces Herself**: When Lyndi says, "Mr. Roth, it's Nurse Lyndi," Mr. Roth smiles warmly and responds, "Ah, Nurse Lyndi! Come in, come in. Glad to see you."

**Patient Interaction**:

- **Mr. Roth's Position**: Mr. Roth is on his bed.
- **Chart Update**: Pressing the action button on his chart will update it.
- **Dialogue with Mr. Roth**:
  - Pressing the dialogue button will prompt Lyndi to ask, "How are you doing?"
  - Pressing the dialogue button again, or long pressing the first time, Lyndi will ask, "What can I do for you?" Mr. Roth will list two tasks initially. There are a total of five tasks to complete, but only two will be listed at first.
  - After completing one task, pressing the dialogue button will prompt Lyndi to ask, "Anything else?" Mr. Roth will respond with an uncompleted task and introduce a new one. If both tasks are completed, he will list two new tasks until all five are completed.
  - After the fifth task is completed, pressing the dialogue button will have Lyndi ask, "Anything else?" Mr. Roth will reply, "Nothing more, I am ready for today."
  - **Departure**: Pressing the dialogue button after Mr. Roth says he is ready for today will prompt Lyndi to reply, "That is all for now then, Mr. Roth," announcing her departure. Alternatively, long pressing the dialogue button at any point will also trigger the departure dialogue.

**Mr. Roth's Tasks**:

1. **Adjust the Pillows**:

   - **Task**: Mr. Roth says, "Could you adjust my pillows, Nurse? I think they’ve gone a bit flat."
   - **Mechanic**: Requires a long press or pulling up the ring menu to adjust. Pressing the action button alone will simply grab and place the pillow.

2. **Fetch a Newspaper**:

   - **Task**: Mr. Roth says, "I’d love to catch up on today’s news. Could you fetch me a newspaper?"
   - **Mechanic**: This is a straightforward task. Lyndi needs to grab the newspaper and place it on Mr. Roth’s side table.

3. **Bring a Glass of Water**:

   - **Task**: Mr. Roth says, "Could you bring me a glass of water, please? I’m feeling a bit parched."
   - **Mechanic**: This is more complex. Lyndi must grab the pitcher, long press to pour water into the glass, then place the pitcher down. She then grabs the glass and hands it to Mr. Roth. Lyndi must walk slowly while holding the glass to avoid spilling it.

4. **Open the Curtains**:

   - **Task**: Mr. Roth says, "Would you mind opening the curtains a bit more? I’d like to see the view outside."
   - **Mechanic**: This can be accomplished by long pressing the action button to pull the curtains, or by jumping and pressing either the action or attack button to reach the ropes. Lyndi must then press the action button on the rope to pull it.

5. **Tidy Up the Side Table**:

   - **Task**: Mr. Roth says, "This side table has gotten a bit cluttered. Could you tidy it up for me, please?"
   - **Mechanic**: Lyndi must long press the action button to clean and collect rubbish. She then presses or long presses on the trash can to place the rubbish inside it.

- **Ring Menu**: Pulling up the ring menu will show all available options in the given context, except the jump to make the curtain cord reachable.

**Dialogue Ring Menu**:

- Pulling the dialogue ring menu will display any currently available dialogue options, including:

  - "How are you doing, Mr. Roth?" (Primary)
  - "What can I do for you?" (Primary)
  - "Anything else?" (Primary, after completing a task)
  - "That is all for now, Mr. Roth" (Primary, after long press or departure)
  - "That is all for now then, Mr. Roth" (Primary, after Mr. Roth is ready for the day)
  - **Additional Conversation Option**: "Are you enjoying your vacation, Mr. Roth?" (Primary) - This will initiate a conversation about Mr. Roth's vacation, during which he will be happy to talk about himself.

- **Conversation Branches**:

  - When engaging in the "vacation" conversation, there will be three replies available for Lyndi, chosen from the ring menu, to branch out the conversation. Mr. Roth will respond accordingly, and the conversation will end either naturally, when Lyndi announces her departure, or if she just leaves without finishing it.
---
### **Act 7.2: Ms. Liya**

- **Narrative**: Ms. Liya is not a wealthy or particularly influential person but was once a nurse at the hospital. She volunteered to serve in the war effort, where she lost her leg. She is now wheelchair-bound and recovering. The hospital administrator placed her in a private room as an expression of gratitude for her sacrifice. Like Mr. Roth, she has five tasks for Lyndi, which are given one at a time.

**Initial Interaction Responses**:
- **Barges In**: Ms. Liya raises an eyebrow and says, "You know, Lyndi, a little courtesy goes a long way."
- **Knocks Only**: Ms. Liya looks up, slightly surprised, and says, "Come in, Lyndi. You don't need to be shy."
- **Announces Herself**: When Lyndi says, "Ms. Liya, it's Nurse Lyndi," Ms. Liya smiles warmly and responds, "Lyndi, come in. It's always nice to see you."

**Patient Interaction**:
- **Ms. Liya's Position**: She is on her bed, with her wheelchair next to it, at the side opposite the door.
- **Chart Update**: Pressing the action button on her chart will update it.
- **Dialogue with Ms. Liya**:
  - Pressing the dialogue button will prompt Lyndi to ask, "Did you sleep well, Ms. Liya?" The conversation will focus on Ms. Liya's well-being.
  - After helping her into her wheelchair, the option "If I may ask, how did you lose your leg?" becomes available, allowing Ms. Liya to discuss her experiences during the war.
  - After the moment by the window, "Do you miss being a nurse?" becomes available, and the conversation shifts to her time as a nurse. Each topic will only list one reply at a time.
  - The conversation ends when the replies are exhausted, thus ending naturally, or if Lyndi announces her departure, or leaves the room.

**Ms. Liya's Tasks**:

1. **Get Her Shawl**:
   - **Task**: Ms. Liya says, "Lyndi, would you mind getting my shawl? It’s a bit chilly."
   - **Mechanic**: Lyndi must locate the shawl in the room, grab it, and place it over Ms. Liya's shoulders.

2. **Bring Water**:
   - **Task**: Ms. Liya says, "Could I trouble you for a glass of water, Lyndi?"
   - **Mechanic**: Similar to Mr. Roth's task, Lyndi must grab the pitcher, long press to pour water into the glass, place the pitcher down, then grab the glass and hand it to Ms. Liya. Lyndi must walk carefully while holding the glass to avoid spilling.

3. **Help Her to Her Wheelchair**:
   - **Task**: Ms. Liya says, "Can you help me into my wheelchair, please?"
   - **Mechanic**: Lyndi must grab the wheelchair, place it next to the bed, and long press the action button to help Ms. Liya get into her wheelchair.

4. **Take Her to the Window**:
   - **Task**: Ms. Liya says, "I'd love to see the view. Could you take me to the window?"
   - **Mechanic**: Lyndi must grab the wheelchair and maneuver it to the window.

5. **A Moment of Reflection**:
   - **Task**: Once at the window, Ms. Liya closes her eyes and takes a deep breath. After a moment, she opens her eyes and says, "You know, Lyndi, I wish I could go outside again."
   - **Mechanic**: This task is more about listening. Lyndi stands by as Ms. Liya takes her moment.

**Dialogue Ring Menu**:
- Pulling up the dialogue ring menu will display any currently available dialogue options, including:
  - "Did you sleep well, Ms. Liya?" (Primary)
  - "If I may ask, how did you lose your leg?" (Primary, after helping her into her wheelchair)
  - "Do you miss being a nurse?" (Primary, after the moment by the window)
  - **Additional Conversation**: Each topic only lists one reply at a time, and Ms. Liya responds accordingly.
- **Impact on Final Conversation**: Going through the "losing her leg" and "missing being a nurse" conversations will unlock additional replies available during the final conversation with Lannet.

### **Act 7.3a: Mr. Gregor (Does Not Pass Away)**

- **Narrative**: Mr. Gregor is a wealthy banker, known for his strong personality. He recently suffered a heart attack and is now recovering. He is headstrong and stubborn, though a bit more reflective since his heart attack. Mr. Gregor is in a wheelchair and has a pet dog with him.

**Initial Interaction Responses**:
- **Barges In**: Mr. Gregor gives a disapproving frown and says, "Do you make it a habit of not knocking, Nurse? A little respect goes a long way."
- **Knocks Only**: Mr. Gregor looks up and nods, "Come in, Nurse. Next time, don't be afraid to announce yourself."
- **Announces Herself**: When Lyndi says, "Mr. Gregor, it's Nurse Lyndi," Mr. Gregor softens a bit and responds, "Nurse Lyndi, thank you. Come in."

**Patient Interaction**:
- **Mr. Gregor's Position**: Mr. Gregor is seated in his wheelchair with his pet dog by his side.
- **Chart Update**: Pressing the action button on his chart will update it.
- **Dialogue with Mr. Gregor**:
  - Pressing the dialogue button will prompt Lyndi to ask, "How are you feeling today, Mr. Gregor?"
  - After the initial question, Lyndi can ask, "What can I do for you today, Mr. Gregor?" He will then list two tasks that need to be completed.
  - Similar to other patients, after completing one task, pressing the dialogue button will prompt Lyndi to ask, "Anything else?" Mr. Gregor will provide the next task, until all tasks are completed.
  - After all tasks are completed, pressing the dialogue button will prompt Mr. Gregor to respond, "Thank you, Nurse. That will be all for today."
  - **Departure**: Pressing the dialogue button after Mr. Gregor says he is ready for the day will prompt Lyndi to say, "That is all for now then, Mr. Gregor," announcing her departure. Alternatively, long pressing the dialogue button at any point will also trigger the departure dialogue.

**Mr. Gregor's Tasks**:

1. **Adjust the Wheelchair Position**:
   - **Task**: Mr. Gregor says, "Nurse, could you adjust my wheelchair closer to the window? I want to see the view."
   - **Mechanic**: Lyndi must grab the wheelchair handles and move Mr. Gregor closer to the window.

2. **Open the Curtains**:
   - **Task**: Mr. Gregor says, "Would you mind opening the curtains a bit more? The sunlight feels nice."
   - **Mechanic**: Similar to Mr. Roth’s task, Lyndi can long press the action button to pull the curtains or jump and press either the action or attack button to reach the ropes. Pressing the action button on the rope will pull it open.

3. **Fetch the Flower from Outside**:
   - **Task**: Mr. Gregor says, "You see that tree outside? There’s a flower I’d love to have from it. Could you bring me one?"
   - **Mechanic**: Lyndi must go outside, jump to reach a branch, and press the action or attack button to shake the tree. Once the flower falls, she picks it up and brings it to Mr. Gregor.

4. **Pet the Dog**:
   - **Task**: Mr. Gregor says, "My dog’s feeling a bit restless. Could you give him some attention?"
   - **Mechanic**: Lyndi can press the action button to pet the dog. The dog will react positively, and Mr. Gregor will smile and comment, "He likes you."

5. **Tidy Up the Room**:
   - **Task**: Mr. Gregor says, "This room feels a bit cluttered. Would you mind tidying it up?"
   - **Mechanic**: Lyndi must long press the action button to clean up items around the room, then dispose of the rubbish in the trash can.

**Dialogue Ring Menu**:
- Pulling up the dialogue ring menu will display any currently available dialogue options, including:
  - "How are you feeling today, Mr. Gregor?" (Primary)
  - "What can I do for you today, Mr. Gregor?" (Primary)
  - "Anything else?" (Primary, after completing a task)
  - "That is all for now, Mr. Gregor" (Primary, after long press or departure)
  - "That is all for now then, Mr. Gregor" (Primary, after Mr. Gregor is ready for the day)
  - **Additional Conversation Option**: "Have you thought much about things since the heart attack?" (Primary) - This will initiate a more reflective conversation with Mr. Gregor.

- **Conversation Branches**:
  - When engaging in the reflective conversation, there will be three replies available for Lyndi, chosen from the ring menu, to branch out the conversation. Mr. Gregor will respond thoughtfully, revealing his changed perspective on life since the heart attack. The conversation can end naturally, when Lyndi announces her departure, or if she just leaves without finishing it.

**Patient Order**: Tasks can be completed in any order based on Mr. Gregor's requests, and the conversation can be initiated at any point during the interaction.

---

#### **Act 7.3b: Mr. Gregor's Passing**

**Mr. Gregor's Passing Timeline**: Mr. Gregor is set to pass away some time after the beginning of the narrative. The narrative differs depending on which stage Lyndi is present during.

---

#### **Stage 7.3a: Has Not Passed**

- As long as Mr. Gregor has not passed, Lyndi can finish as many or as few tasks as the player chooses. The next act can begin without Mr. Gregor having passed, and this will not affect the narrative.

#### **Stage 7.3b.1: Mr. Gregor Passes**

- Regardless of what Mr. Gregor is doing or saying, when he passes away, he will slow down, close his eyes, exhale one last time, and slump in his wheelchair, with his arms falling limp by his side.
- A few moments later, his dog will start barking. If Lyndi is present, **character agency** will take over:
  - **Character Agency**: Lyndi will no longer respond to player input. When the dog starts barking, she will say, "Mr. Gregor?" She will turn around, face Mr. Gregor, and then shout, "Mr. Gregor!" before heading towards him. She will kneel beside him and start crying, with no player input. She will remain crying until the player mashes the controller enough to regain control, at which point she will stand up, wipe her tears, and respond to player input again.
  - Initially, mashing the controller won't produce a visible effect, indicating Lyndi’s initial struggle with grief. After several attempts, she will mutter one of three phrases, such as "I have to pull myself together…" or "Mr. Gregor needs help…" before finally regaining her composure. If the player stops mashing too early, she will slump back down and resume crying.
  - Lyndi can then look for a doctor on the floor and bring him to Mr. Gregor. Once the doctor is with Mr. Gregor, Lyndi can leave.
  - **Lannet's Response**: Lannet will react to the barking dog, regardless of what she is doing:
    - She will excuse herself from the patient she is tending to and investigate the barking.
    - If Lyndi is still crying when Lannet arrives, Lannet will shake Lyndi to restore player control. If Lyndi is composed, they will search for the doctor together.
    - If Lannet's frustration level is high, she will look for the doctor alone without first consoling Lyndi. When the doctor arrives, he will snap Lyndi back to her senses, restoring player control.

#### **Stage 7.3b.2: Mr. Gregor's Dog Barking**

- **Dog Barking**: The dog's barking can be heard in the hallway and in the private rooms. Lyndi can choose to ignore it, but Mr. Roth and Ms. Liya will comment on the barking dog if Lyndi tends to them while ignoring Mr. Gregor.

- **Lannet Will Not Ignore It**:

  - Lannet will excuse herself from her current patient and investigate the barking.
  - She will enter Mr. Gregor's room, find him passed away, and immediately begin searching for a doctor.
  - If Lyndi chooses to investigate the barking, she can join Lannet in finding a doctor.

- **Shorter Character Agency for Lyndi**:

  - If Lyndi enters Mr. Gregor's room, she will realize that he has passed.
  - A shorter character agency sequence will play: Lyndi will cover her mouth in shock, and only two attempts are needed to regain control.
  - If Lannet is present, she will yell, "Lyndi!" to snap her back. The doctors arriving will also snap Lyndi back to her senses. Once the doctors arrive, the dog will stop barking.

- **Ignoring the Dog**:

  - If Lyndi fully ignores the barking and does not investigate, Lannet will eventually find her in one of the other private rooms after the doctors have taken Mr. Gregor to the morgue. Lannet will excuse both herself and Lyndi from Lyndi's current patient, ending this act and starting Act 8.

#### **Stage 7.3b.3: Doctors Arrive**

- **Doctors at Mr. Gregor's Room**:
  - The doctors have already arrived and are in Mr. Gregor's room, pronouncing him dead and preparing his body to be taken to the morgue.
  - If Lyndi arrives while the doctors are inside, they will block both Lyndi and Lannet from entering, informing them of Mr. Gregor's passing.
  - A small character agency sequence will play: Lyndi will cover her mouth in shock, and either Lannet, the doctors, or two player attempts will snap her back.
  - Lannet will signal Lyndi to keep moving, and they will proceed to **Act 8**.

#### **Stage 7.3b.4: Mr. Gregor's Body Taken to the Morgue**

- **Mr. Gregor's Body Has Already Been Taken to the Morgue**:

  - This stage only occurs if the previous stages take too much time, resulting in Mr. Gregor having already passed away and being taken to the morgue before Lyndi arrives.
  - **Dog No Longer Barking**: Mr. Gregor's dog has stopped barking and is now inside the empty room, appearing anxious.
  - **No Investigation by Lannet**: Since the dog is no longer barking, Lannet will not investigate, and Mr. Gregor's room remains empty except for the dog.

- **Tending to Other Patients**:

  - When tending to **Mr. Roth** and **Ms. Liya**, they may comment on how the barking has stopped, subtly hinting at the progression of events regarding Mr. Gregor.

- **Entering Mr. Gregor's Room**:

  - When Lyndi enters the empty room, a subtle dialogue prompt will appear and remain until she leaves the room.
  - If Lyndi engages the prompt, she will have the option in the dialogue ring menu to say, "Where did he go?"
  - **Collecting the Chart**: The only mandatory task for Lyndi is to collect Mr. Gregor's chart, ensuring the patient's records are up to date.

**Dog Side Story**:

- Mr. Gregor's dog appears visibly anxious in the empty room.
- Lyndi can grab the dog's leash, initiating a **side story** involving Mr. Gregor's dog:
  - **Two Options**:
    1. **Take the Dog to the Head Nurse**: Lyndi can choose to bring the dog to the head nurse, ensuring that it is properly cared for.
    2. **Follow the Dog's Lead**: Alternatively, Lyndi can let the dog guide her, which will lead her towards the **morgue**, where Mr. Gregor's body is now located.
  - If Lyndi chooses to take the dog, she will be absent from the remaining acts until she eventually rejoins Lannet.
  - Dealing with the dog at this point will **increase Lannet's frustration**, as Lyndi is neglecting her responsibilities.

**Departure from the Room**:

- Once Lyndi has collected the chart and exits the room, Lannet will signal Lyndi to continue, prompting the transition to **Act 8**.

**Impact on Lannet:**

**If Lyndi and Lannet don't witness Mr. Gregor's passing (Stages 7.3a and 7.3b.4):**

- **Increases Frustration**: Any uncompleted task that Lannet had to finish. Engaging with the dog, either petting or grabbing the leash. Ignoring the dog barking, forcing Lannet to deal with Mr. Gregor's passing alone.
- **Increases Respect**: Engaging in conversations with the patients.

**If Lyndi and Lannet witness Mr. Gregor's passing (Stages 7.3b.1, 7.3b.2, 7.3b.3):**

- **Increases Frustration**: Having to snap Lyndi back to her senses, or a doctor having to do that. Ignoring the dog barking, forcing Lannet to deal with Mr. Gregor's passing alone.
- **Reduces Frustration**: Lyndi regaining her composure.
- **Increases Respect**: Lyndi crying over Mr. Gregor's death. Lyndi regaining her composure.

Additionally, if Lyndi and Lannet witness Mr. Gregor's passing, any uncompleted tasks will remain uncompleted, and Lannet will not finish them for Lyndi. The pass/fail state of the three patients will be ignored in the report. Due to the emergency of Mr. Gregor's passing, Lannet will omit all of it from the report.

---

## **Act 8: Reporting Back - Quick Reaction Tutorial**

- **Narrative**: Regardless of how Act 7 unfolded, Lyndi and Lannet start heading back to the head nurse's office. They both go down the stairs. While walking down a corridor, a medical team rushes a patient down the hallway, shouting for people to clear the way. A quick reaction prompt appears. If Lyndi presses the action button, she successfully gets out of the way. If she fails, Lannet shoves Lyndi out of the way, scattering their collected charts.

  - If the charts scatter, Lyndi and Lannet will begin collecting the charts. Lannet will pick up most of them, but her frustration level will determine how many: if her frustration is high, she will pick up fewer; if it is low, she will pick up more. If Lyndi fails to pick up the remaining charts, those charts will be missing.
  - If Lyndi successfully dodges the medical team, nothing else happens, and they both continue to the head nurse's office without any disruption.

- **Dog Side Story**:

  - If the dog side story was started in Act 7 and Lyndi is taking the dog to the head nurse, she may still have the dog during this act.
  - The dog will be unruly, wanting to follow Mr. Gregor's scent to the morgue rather than heading to the head nurse's office.
  - The dog will dodge the medical team automatically, but if Lyndi fails to dodge, she will let go of the leash, and the dog will run off towards the morgue. Lyndi can choose to pursue the dog immediately.
  - If the player had chosen to take the dog to the morgue initially, Lyndi will be absent from this act.

- **If Lyndi Witnesses Mr. Gregor's Passing in Act 7**:

  - A subtle dialogue prompt appears, allowing Lyndi to mention Mr. Gregor's passing.
  - Lannet will respond, dismissing the conversation.
  - Depending on what happened, Lannet's response will be different:
    - "We are nurses, get used to it" if Lyndi was crying and Lannet had to shake her.
    - "Do your job next time" if Lyndi ignored the dog's barking.
    - "We did our job, the doctor will take care of the rest" if they both found the doctor.
    - "We need to keep working" in all other situations.
  - Engaging with this dialogue increases Lannet's respect.

- **Impact on Lannet**:

  - **Increases Frustration**: Failing to dodge the medical team, each chart Lannet picks up, Lyndi having the dog, Lyndi leaving after the dog, and Lyndi being absent.
  - **Decreases Frustration**: Lyndi successfully dodging the medical team.
  - **Increases Respect**: Lyndi picking up more charts than Lannet, keeping hold of the dog's leash despite the chaos, engaging in the subtle dialogue that mentions Mr. Gregor's passing.

---

## **Act 9: The Nurse's Office - Report**

- **Narrative**: Upon arriving at the head nurse's office, both Lyndi and Lannet turn in their collected charts. If the charts were scattered in the previous act, some charts may be missing. Lannet will collect most but not all of them, which affects the report. If her frustration level is high enough, she will remark on every area in which Lyndi failed; otherwise, she will remain silent.

- **Report Details**:
  - **Act 1 - Lyndi Gets Startled**: "Lyndi is skittish."
  - **Act 2 - Lyndi Gets Dragged to the First Room**: "Lacks motivation."
  - **Act 3 - Lannet Finishes One of Her Beds**: "She moves slow."
  - **Act 4 - Mr. Kendri Conversation Takes Too Long**: "She gets distracted easily."
  - **Act 4 - Wakes Up the Sleeping Patient**: "She is a bother to the patients."
  - **Act 5 - Lannet Chooses a Line First**: "She doesn't take the initiative."
  - **Act 5 - Lannet Finishes at Least One Bed on Lyndi's Row**: "Can't manage her time." However, if the warmth nurse comments on Lannet, she won't say this line.
  - **Act 6 - If Lyndi Has the Conversation and Is Mostly Frustrating**: "She is nosy."
  - **Act 6 - If Lyndi Has the Conversation and Is Mostly Somber**: "She ... doesn't know when to shut up."
  - **Act 6 - If Lyndi Has the Conversation and Is Mostly Reflective**: Lannet won’t say anything but has a brief pause. During the pause, a subtle dialogue prompt appears. If engaged, Lyndi will just say, "Lannet..."
  - **Act 7 - If Mr. Gregor Doesn't Pass Away, and Lannet Tended to One of Her Patients**: "She isn't efficient."
  - **Act 7 - If Lyndi Interacts with Mr. Gregor's Dog**: "She can't keep herself presentable."
  - **Act 7 - If Lyndi Witnesses Mr. Gregor's Passing**: Lannet won't say anything regarding Act 7. She will have a brief pause. During the pause, a subtle dialogue appears, allowing Lyndi to say, "Mr. Gregor... a patient... he..." The head nurse will cut her off and respond, "I heard. He was a great man. You need to understand, Lyndi. We are nurses, and this is a hospital. This happens all the time." One more subtle dialogue prompt will allow Lyndi to say, "Yes, ma'am."
  - **Act 8 - If Lyndi Failed to Dodge**: "Doesn't pay attention."
  - **Act 8 - Not All Charts Were Collected**: "She lost paperwork."
  - **Act 8 - She Let Go of the Dog's Leash**: "She set a dog loose."
  - **If Lyndi Engages in the Subtle Dialogue About Mr. Gregor's Passing**: Lannet won't mention anything from Act 8.
  - **In Any Act, If the Struggle State Was Triggered**: "And she can't follow directions."

- **Head Nurse's Comment**: If Lannet is critical, the head nurse will add a comment of understanding: "I understand you are both new nurses, and mistakes will happen. It's better to act and make mistakes than to hesitate because you're afraid of doing something wrong."

- **Impact on Lannet**
  - **Reduce Frustration**: Each critical line Lannet says.
  - **Increase Respect**: Turning in all the charts, engaging in each subtle dialogue of this act.

- **Additional Details**:
  - The more critical lines Lannet says, the more frustrated her animation becomes, as she is finally able to let loose. If Lyndi engages with a subtle dialogue, Lannet's animation will be a bit calmer.
  - After Lannet finishes her critical report, there will be a pause before the head nurse responds. During the pause, there will be a subtle dialogue prompt for Lyndi to reply. The ring menu will have replies for each act in which Lannet said a critical line. When Lyndi starts speaking her reply, the head nurse will cut her off and say, "You'll do better next time, won't you, Lyndi?" Another subtle dialogue prompt will allow Lyndi to reply, "Yes, ma'am."
  - **Ring Menu (up to 8 replies)**:
    - **Act 1**: "I'll work on keeping calm."
    - **Act 2**: "I'll push myself harder."
    - **Act 3**: "I need to pick up the pace, I know."
    - **Act 4**: "I'll make sure to be more attentive."
    - **Act 5**: "I should've stepped up."
    - **Act 6**: "I didn't mean to pry."
    - **Act 7**: "I'll be more mindful."
    - **Act 8**: "I know I should've been more aware."
  - There won't be a chance for Lyndi to speak before Lannet starts being critical, as Lannet will let off steam immediately, reducing her frustration.
  - In Act 10, Lyndi will be able to find the missing charts, but this will not impact Lannet.
  - Lyndi is intimidated and embarrassed during Lannet's critical report. She will only have a chance to reply after Lannet finishes, but the head nurse will always cut her off.
  - In the next act, Lannet goes to the cafeteria to eat, giving the player a chance to act without Lannet's presence, providing a break from interaction with her.

---

## **Act 10: Break - Free Roam**

- **Narrative**: Lyndi and Lannet are free for a period of time. Lannet goes to the cafeteria and gets something to eat, then goes to a corner of the cafeteria, grabs a book, and starts eating and reading. She will stay like this for the entirety of the break. Lyndi can join her, but Lannet will grow frustrated and remain unresponsive to Lyndi's dialogue. Lyndi can also eat anywhere else, and Lannet will be fine with that. Lyndi is also free to explore anywhere in the hospital.

- **Interactions**: Lyndi can interact with several characters during the break:
  - **The Infirmary**: The first two rooms are part of the infirmary. There is a new patient, Dania, in the first room, and in the second room, Mr. Kendri, the sleeping patient Andrew, and the two patients Lannet tended to—Ruen and Mr. Kalo.

---

**Hospital Interactions**

During Act 10, Lyndi can explore various areas of the hospital and engage in different interactions:

- **Main Lobby**: 
  - Lyndi can gossip with the receptionist.
  - She can talk to patients waiting but is unable to fulfill any requests they have besides getting water, as they have yet to be admitted.

- **Consulting Rooms**:
  - Lyndi can speak with doctors if they are not with a patient. They may ask her to retrieve something for them.

- **Infirmary**:
  - There are two other infirmary rooms. Lyndi can speak with patients there and fulfill their requests.

- **Both Wards**:
  - Walking down the aisles, Lyndi can respond to minor patient needs, like retrieving dropped items, offering words of comfort, or helping a patient with a simple request.
  - There are 3 patients in the wards who have returned from the war. Lyndi can engage them in conversation about their experiences.

- **Surgery**:
  - Lyndi can only access the gallery on the second floor. She can observe a surgery in progress.

- **Pediatric Ward**:

- **1st Nurse Station**:
  - Lyndi can gossip with other nurses there.

- **Administrative Offices (Clerk Office, Administrator Office, Records)**:
  - The administrator’s office is closed, but Lyndi can wait outside. After the second bell tower ring, Lannet will show up, and the other four nurses will start arriving.
  - Lyndi can gossip with the hospital clerk.
  - She can also go into the records. Character agency prevents her from accessing most records, as she has no reason to look into them. However, records for patients Lyndi has interacted with have character agency that is easier to break, followed by records for patients Lannet has interacted with, and then everyone else.

- **Doctor Break Room**:

## **Act 11: The Administrator's Office - Call for Volunteers**

### **Act 11.1: Outside the Administrator's Office - Hidden Eavesdrop Tutorial**

- **Narrative**: Before the break is over, Lannet and four other nurses start showing up. All five wait until the bell rings. Lannet waits on her own, while the other four gossip with each other. They also graduated with Lyndi and Lannet. 
- **Action**: Lyndi can arrive at any point before the bell rings and may engage in conversation with the other four nurses. She can exchange pleasantries, or if she stands near them, she may listen in on their conversation. They are talking about the war effort and how scared they are. Lyndi can also start a conversation with Lannet, but she is unresponsive. 
- **Lannet's Responses**:
  - If her frustration is low, she will try to end the conversation quickly, giving brief responses like "Not now" or "Stay focused."
  - If her frustration is high, she will castigate not only Lyndi but also the other four nurses, with comments like, "You all need to get a grip. We have a job to do."
- **Bell Rings**: When the bell starts ringing, the doors to the administrator's office open, and the nurses are let in. Any ongoing conversations are immediately dropped.

### **Act 11.2a: The Call - Volunteers Requested**

- **Narrative**: Once the bell stops ringing, the administrator steps out of the room and closes the door. The nurses are left with the director of the nursing school, who they all graduated from. 
  - Director: "Please, gather close. I have to talk to you all." 
  - The nurses line up, leaving a gap for Lyndi next to Lannet. Once the nurses are lined up, the director continues:
  - "First of all, I want to tell you that I am glad to see you all well. We have not seen each other since you were assigned to this hospital." (pause) "I have come to send a nurse from our honorable school to the front. Several hospitals have sent doctors and nurses to help the war effort. They are all hard at work. From this hospital, they have sent 3 doctors and 5 nurses." (longer pause) "Our school is going to send three nurses, one of whom will be from this class. I don't want to force you; it has to be a volunteer. I want one of you to step forward."
- **Character Agency**: Lyndi loses player input control. Every time the player tries to step forward, Lyndi won't move. Instead, an inner monologue appears, showing her thoughts:
  - First, on why she shouldn't go, thinking about her friends and her life, but she convinces herself to step forward. On the seventh attempt, Lannet will step forward.
  - No matter what, Lannet will always step forward before Lyndi. If a long time passes and Lyndi does not make any effort, Lannet will step forward.
  - After Lannet steps forward, the director will dismiss the nurses. The other four will leave, relieved they weren't chosen. 
- **Exiting**: Lyndi can exit with them or remain in the office. After a moment, the director will tell Lyndi to leave the office. When Lyndi leaves, the door closes, and once she exits the hall, the screen fades to black.
- **Staying in the Hall**: If Lyndi chooses to stay in the hall after the announcement, Lannet will exit the office after some time, which will transition to Act 12.

### **Act 11.2b: Late - Forced Selection**
- **Narrative**: If Lyndi is not present when the bell rings, ending the break, the nurses enter the administrator's office. Once the bell stops, the administrator exits and closes the door. Up until that point, Lyndi can still enter the office, and Act 11.2a will happen. If Lyndi does not make it by the time the administrator closes the doors, Act 11.2b will play out. 
- **Late Arrival**: The administrator proceeds to the cafeteria. If, at any point, he crosses paths with Lyndi, he will comment, "She will have to decide," referring to the director. 
- **Outcome**: After some time, the meeting concludes, and the nurses exit. The director did not ask for volunteers. If Lyndi is outside the office, the nurses and Lannet will tell Lyndi to go inside, where the director is waiting for her.
- **Director's Message**: Once Lyndi is in the office with the director:
  - The director informs Lyndi that she has been selected to help with the war effort and advises her to gather her things and get her affairs in order. They will be leaving in the morning. The director then leaves the office.
  - The game will wait until Lyndi exits the office and the hall before fading to black and starting the epilogue. After much time passes and Lyndi has yet to meet with the director, a message will indicate she has been selected for the war effort before the epilogue begins. 

**Additional Note**:
- If Lannet's frustration level is maxed out, she will not step forward and volunteer, even if Lyndi hesitates. In such a scenario, if Lyndi doesn't volunteer herself, the director will still select Lannet.
- One way to contribute to maxing out Lannet's frustration is for Lyndi to be absent during Act 9. If Lannet is highly frustrated in that act, she gets to voice her criticisms of Lyndi, which helps to lower her frustration. By being absent, Lyndi prevents Lannet from releasing that frustration, thus maintaining a high frustration level that would otherwise have been reduced. 
- This situation can allow Lyndi to volunteer herself instead, leading to Act 12b.

**Impact on Lannet**:
- **Increase Frustration**:
  - Lyndi being late or not present at the meeting.
  - Attempting to engage in conversation if Lannet is already frustrated.
- **Decrease Frustration**:
  - If Lyndi arrives early and exchanges pleasantries with the other nurses.
  - Showing up and standing by Lannet when the director speaks.
- **Increase Respect**:
  - Every attempt Lyndi makes to step forward, demonstrating determination.

## **Act 12: Goodbye**

### **Act 12a: Lannet’s Departure**

- **Narrative**: This act triggers after Act 11.2a if Lannet volunteers to go to the front. When she exits the administrator's office, she walks down the hallway towards the main stairs. Lyndi can follow her.
- **Engagement**: Attempting to engage Lannet in conversation (press, long-press, or dialogue ring menu) will prompt standard greetings, which Lannet will dismiss with, "I don't have time."
  - **Subtle Dialogue Prompt**: At this point, a subtle dialogue prompt appears, allowing Lyndi to say, "Let me take your place."
    - **Lannet’s Response**: Lannet stops momentarily, turning back with a "What?" This marks the start of their final conversation. Depending on Lannet’s respect level, her walking pace will slow, extending the conversation time as they proceed down the stairs.
    - **Conversation**:
      - Various actions Lyndi performed throughout the game will unlock replies and dialogue options. For example, Ms. Liya's conversations and opinions about Lannet could offer different responses.
      - Lyndi can continue issuing replies, and Lannet will respond until the replies are exhausted, or they reach the bottom of the stairs.
      - If Lyndi’s replies frustrate Lannet too much, she will abruptly end the conversation with, "Shut up!" and rush off.
      - **Final Statements**:
        - **High Frustration**: "Just shut up, Lyndi. I don't want to hear it. I told you I hate nosy people."
        - **Neutral**: "I need to get ready."
        - **High Respect**: "You are a great nurse, and you will do great here. Follow your path, and I'll follow mine. I need to get my things in order."

### **Act 12b: Lannet’s Final Words**

- **Trigger**: Occurs if Lyndi volunteers for the front in Act 11.2b because Lannet’s frustration is maxed out and she didn’t step forward.
- **Conversation Dynamics**:
  - As Lyndi exits the office, Lannet is waiting outside. She begins trying to express her respect and thoughts to Lyndi.
  - **Player Interaction**:
    - **Interruption**: A subtle dialogue prompt appears during Lannet’s attempt. If the player chooses, Lyndi can interrupt with, "I wish we could have been friends."
      - **Lannet’s Response**: After a brief pause, Lannet replies, "I never liked you, Lyndi... because of your joy. But I know you will be a great nurse. I hope for your safe return." Lannet then exits, ending the act.
    - **No Interruption**: If Lyndi does not interrupt, she can respond to Lannet’s attempt with, "Thank you, Lannet. I really appreciate you having been at my side."
      - **Lannet’s Reaction**: Lannet wells up slightly and responds with, "Take care, Lyndi." She then exits, ending the act.

## **Epilogue A: Lannet’s Departure**

- **Narrative**: The screen fades back to the outside of the hospital. A group of nurses has gathered, and a carriage is waiting. The director and Lannet walk down the line of nurses toward the carriage, with Lyndi among the group. As they reach the end, just before boarding the carriage, Lannet pauses.
  
  - **Lannet’s Action**:
    - **High Frustration**: Lannet resumes getting into the carriage without looking back.
    - **Neutral**: Lannet turns around to face the gathered nurses and says, "Thank you, all of you," before turning back to board the carriage.
    - **High Respect**: Lannet turns around, addresses the crowd as she would in the neutral scenario, and then approaches Lyndi. She says, "Take care, Lyndi." After a few moments, she returns to the carriage, ready to board. A subtle dialogue prompt appears, allowing Lyndi to say something in return:
      - **Lyndi’s Possible Replies**:
        - "Take care, too, Lannet."
        - "We’ll see each other again, Lannet."
        - "Thank you, Lannet."
    - **Lannet’s Reactions**: She wells up slightly regardless of which reply is chosen, but her reaction varies:
      - If Lyndi says, "Take care, too, Lannet," she wipes her tears with one hand.
      - If Lyndi says, "We’ll see each other again, Lannet," she wipes her tears with both hands.
      - If Lyndi says, "Thank you, Lannet," she lets out a snivel before wiping her tears with her sleeve. This option triggers a quick reaction prompt for Lyndi to give Lannet a hug, but only if Lannet’s frustration is low.
  
- **Carriage Departure**: Regardless of the exchanges, Lannet eventually boards the carriage. The director says a few final words to the gathered nurses, and then the carriage departs. The screen pans up, fades to white, and the game ends.

## **Epilogue B: Lyndi’s Departure**

- **Trigger**: This epilogue occurs if Lyndi was not present for the meeting and was chosen to volunteer or if she stepped forward in Act 11.2b when Lannet’s frustration was maxed out.
  
- **Narrative**: The scene mirrors Epilogue A, but the roles are reversed. Lyndi is walking with the director toward the carriage, and Lannet is among the nurses gathered outside.
  
  - **Lyndi’s Action**: 
    - Before Lyndi can board, a character agency sequence occurs, where the player briefly loses control. After two attempts, control is regained, and Lyndi boards the carriage.
    - **Subtle Dialogue**: During the character agency sequence, a subtle dialogue prompt appears, allowing Lyndi to address the gathered nurses and thank them. If Lyndi chooses to speak, and if Lannet’s respect is high, she will step forward and say, "Take care, Lyndi." Another subtle dialogue prompt allows Lyndi to respond:
      - **Possible Replies**:
        - "Take care, too, Lannet."
        - "We’ll see each other again, Lannet."
        - "Thank you, Lannet."
    - **Lannet’s Reaction**: Similar to Epilogue A, Lannet wells up and wipes her tears differently based on the response. If Lyndi says "Thank you, Lannet," there is also a quick reaction prompt for a hug.
  
- **Carriage Departure**: After the exchanges, Lyndi boards the carriage, the director addresses the nurses, and the carriage departs. The screen pans up, fades to white, ending the narrative.
