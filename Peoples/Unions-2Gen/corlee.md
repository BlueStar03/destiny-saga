# Corlee

In the World of Threa, there are 21 races. This is a description of a race that lives in the world of Threa, the Corlee. That I will describe

---

The Corle are a matriarchal mercantile people. however, more often than not. they seek dishonest ways to get their coin.

---

appearance wise, they have canine characteristics. Their skin is covered in fur. The patterns on their fur are inspired by real world dogs, like Labrador, dalmatians and golden retriever to name a few. males can reach a height of 6 feet. females tend to be taller and can reach a height 7.5 feet. They both tend to have muscular builds. They have four fingered hands and four toed feet. They have long floppy ears, and they let their hair grow big.

---

of note is how the color of their eyes and hair are determined. There are six possible colors either the hair or eyes can be. these six possible colors are split in two categories. Red, Green and Blue form one category, Cyan, magenta and yellow form the other. A child is born with colors that the parents do not have. If the parents have red and green eyes, the child will be born with blue eyes. in contrast, if the parents both have magenta hair, the child may have cyan or yellow hair. If the parents are mixed categories, the possibilities of color expand. The analogous colors are considered. Red with cyan, green and magenta, blue and yellow. for example, if the parents have green and yellow eyes, the child can be born with red or cyan color eyes. hair colors have an additional function. If the child would be born with a RGB color hair, there is a slight chance it may be white instead. similar with CMY children can be born with black hair. If any parent has either black or white hair, their children may have any color from the respective category, minus the standard color of the other parent. for example if one parent has white hair, and the other has red hair. The child may be green or blue. In contrast, if one parent has black hair and the other has red hair, the child may be cyan, magenta or yellow

---

for attire, females wear sleeveless shirt, long shorts, heavy boots and legwarmer. they also wear ponchos and shawls of a variety of colors and styles. they may also wear a headband and tie their ears together. male have a similar selection. except that they don't wear ponchos, nor shawls. also, males wear either short sleeve or long sleeve shirts. it is consider provocative for males to have uncovered shoulders.

---

Commoners tend to use a variety of colors for their clothing. males use straight line patters, while females use curved line patterns.  more well off Corle wear predominately black and white attire. they also have ornament. Males use tags and rivets for ornamentation. females put spikes for ornaments. Corle also wears armlength finger less gloves.

[META NOTE: The Design of this style is inspired by real life punk, metal and glam rock aesthetics. ]

---

The Corle themselves don't have a nation of their own. They live among other races. However, there are factions that can exert undue influence in their assumed territories. they may even supplant the local governance with their own.
There are two broad populations. By far the largest are the commoners. They just live their lives just as any other would. the other population is the source of power and corruption. The Corlee Families. the families have establish vast trade networks, sometimes honestly, most of the time not so honestly. The Families use this trade networks to exert their control. they bribe, racketeering, traffic, counterfeit, and facilitate other illicit activities. Each family exerts their protection in their respective networks. they may establish monopolies, granting them complete control of essential supplies for a town or village. they may suplant local governance with their own. either with local figurheads, or a an actual corlee.

---

The Corlee are a matriarchal kleptocracy. They are stateless. They live within various existing nations, but they maintain their own cultural identity. there are two broad populations, The commoners, and the families. The commoners are by far the largest. They are simply everyday people, living through their lives. following any laws and rules in whatever city or nation they live in. The Families is where power and corruption lie. They form vast trade networks that influence local economies. While there are some honest merchants. a fair number engage in illicit activities, bribe racketeering, arson, extortion, counterfeit, elimination and more. 

There are multiple roles within the Families, 
- Goons are the muscle, the foot soldiers. 
- Enforcers lead the goons. 
- Regents control various enforcers. 
- The Donna is the head of the family. 
- Mentors advise the Donna. 

Additionally, there are two more non family roles

- Covers that help hide and legitimize the families' activities. Covers are not members of the families but may be coerced to participate. 
- Fixers, same as goons, but not members of the families, fixers are used to keep some distance with whatever the fixers are tasked to do. Fixers can even be Non Corlee

---

Their weapon of choice is the club. a simple yet remarkably effective weapon that excels in blunt damage. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes. small one for easy concealment. larger one for when they are serious. with the strongest more prestigious Family member wielding exceptionally large clubs, not only for intimidation but to exert the maximum amount of pain and damage.

---

The Corlee don't produce armor. their clubs have high defensive stats. they depend on debilitating blows, so they shouldn't be hit back. they still have a natural hardiness. however, there is a piece of garment that can function as armor. the Prestigious shawl, worn by elites and high ranking members of the family. notably the Donna. it isn't much, but it further increases their protection. its jet black coloring inspire an air of prestige.
Prestigious Shawl - Weight light, Defense fair, Slash fair, Pierce fair, blunt, fair, mobility neutral

---

Since the Corlee females are the head of the household, the breadwinners. the bosses. They don't take much part in child rearing. their husbands take care of the children and the household. Mothers are father figures and fathers are mother figures.

while they do not have nations, they do have influence across the land. A Marketplace is the largest influence, typically by a single powerful family. The Medci Marketplace is one of the largest in Threa. there are smaller families, working for more powerful. Their influence are called Shops. The Rotsi Shop, Forents Shop and Lirudce Shop are part of the Medci Marketplace. Shops are handled by either small families, or Regents. the small families are lead by a Donnelle. 

A market and associated shop may or may not respect the existing borders. The Medci Marketplace operates across warring kingdoms. 

---

Commoners are not bound to the families. But there are benefits living within a marketplace. first, a corlee can serve as a cover. while they may not like it, are protected by the family. also, the illicit trade is routed thru watever work they do, providing financial benefit. even if not being a cover, a variety of goods flows constantly thru the marketplace, a better selection at low prices. The famalies also control unwanted crime. sometimes even crime the local goverment doesnt care, or conduct themselves. The Families have an incentive in maintaining their trade networks, so roads and halfway points are well maintained.

---

Marie Adloni is an enforcer. Her Stall, or post, is at Greendirt Town. Greendirt is the central hub for 7 local farms. She and her goons collect "Tribute" from the farms. The harvest collected as "Tribute" will be handed to a cover and transported away, and be traded in the Borga marketplace. What is left of the harvest in the farms is still available for their own local uses. Note, Greendirt Town and the 7 farms are not corlee. they are Lor, and part of a Lor Kingdom. Marie and her goons are "tax collectors", "hired" by the mayor.

[Meta :Naming - as design principle, Corlee names are to be based on italian names, with particular focus mafia movie characters. the name Corlee is after the Corleone Family in the Godfather movies. Medci Family is after House of Medici, a powerful italian family ]

Marie and her goons are "tax collectors", "hired" by the mayor. She actually threatens the mayor, who is a Lor, to accept Marie's activities in the region. she was sent by the family to secure harvest form the farms. So Marie operates in the region without challenge by the local authorities.

---

continuing with the trade network. a stall [maybe workshop a better name than stall, or adjust the terminology] is a post, an operation for the family. with Marie, she took a percentage of the farms harvest. she then offload it to a cover. they just transport the harvest from one point, to another. the cover may engage in other, legitimate business, but the family has "asked" them to do this. it then arrives at a distribution center. there the enforcer, with her goons and covers, cut the harvest into something that can be sold, alongside other product that arrives there. this is then taken to vendors, be it family run or covers. because of the low production cost, and wide variety of goods the extract, corlee merchants have good selections at low prices, and always have stock.

---

A shop consists of a docks, backroom and stands. Docks are where product comes in. extortion, sweatshops, theft, etc. Backrooms are where products from many docks are collected. to core actions is to pack them so they can be sold and also not to be traceable. an Inn at a halfway point tend to be the covers for backrooms. then are the stands, the merchants that receive and sell the product. it may be run by a goon or a cover. local goons may deal with the competition. Docks, Backroom and Stands are run by enforcers. their goons do take some of the work, labor. but they also use covers, willing or not, including menial labor, like the actual packers while goons oversee them. transport is always done by covers. from the dock to backroom, and from backroom to the stands. they may, at times have a goon escort. all this is on shop, run by a regent, or a Donnelle. Marie operates a Dock

---

then there are shop to shop movements. it is possible for product from one shop to go to another shop. depending on the agreement of the shopkeepers. a family can control multiple shops, making transactions between shops seamless. all the shops controlled by, either a single Donna, or a group of Donnelles, is a market.  

---

Goons: the muscle
Capri: the lead goons, answer to a Dulcine or Donnelle
Donnelle: head of a small family. just her Capri and Goons. one shop. if they join a larger family, they become Dulcine. 
Dulcine: a local boss that manages a shop.
Donna: controls multiple shops, a market. 
Matrina: advicor to the Donna
Sicar: an expert assassin, made available by a Donna

---

commoners live in the shadow of the families. most do not want to be associated with them. but cant deny the benefits they bring. a commoner may start as a cover for the family. some may want to actively participate, and become Goons. once they advance to capri, they have it made.  
  
The families dont actively act against those who dont want to "help out" but from time to time, may make an example of someone not willing to do a "favor" for them.   
  
then there are does that seek out the protection of the families, but aren't Corlee. they are used as Fixers. they are like goons, but can handle dirtier work. mainly be able to deny involvement. Fixers can never be part of the family, never be made.   
  
Sicars are expert assassins. while goons and especially fixers, may have to deal with someone, but are a bit messy. Sicars can handle more complex assignments: leave no trace, send a message, looks like an accident. etc. because their services are expensive, only families lead by Donnas have access to them. Donnelles cant afford them. Sicars may have their own crew of goons, covers and fixers, or commandeer the resources of a shop.  sicars also have an apprentice, usually their firstborn daughter.   
  
Outside the families, commoners aren't much different as other peoples. because of their statelessness, they live under the laws of others. besides merchants, other jobs they tend to have are heavy, hard working labor, like construction, mining, lumber, blacksmith.
