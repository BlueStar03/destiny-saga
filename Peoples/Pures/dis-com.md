# Dis Com

In the World of Threa, there are 21 races. This is a description of a race that lives in the world of Threa, the Dis Com. That I will describe.

---

For their appearance: Of Primal form, they have wet noses. Their skin is covered in brown fur, they have green eyes, and their hair ranges between red and orange. The average height is five feet. They have wide, round ears, thin tails, and four-fingered hands and feet. There are differences between males and females: males tend to have thicker, darker fur, with thicker ears and tails, while females have thinner, lighter fur, and their ears and tails are slimmer.

---

[Meta Note: Visually based on rodents: Mice and Rats]

---

The Dis Com are a society entirely governed by military command. They are a genderless, egalitarian, meritocratic autocracy.

---

The Dis Com don’t actually control much territory of their own. The Dis Com Legion is spread across Threa, stationed in forts. The land these forts occupy is leased from the local landowners. In exchange, among other things, the Dis Com are obligated to answer a call to arms when summoned.

---

There are two broad populations, Soldiers and Exiles. Soldiers have 4 classes: Troopers, Sergeants, Specialist, and Officers. Exiles have three classes: First Gen, Second Gen and Third Gen

---

Every Soldier is born a Trooper. They are the main labor force — the grunts, infantry, service, and labor workers. Sergeants are junior command; Troopers may advance to Sergeant. While Sergeants may share some tasks with Troopers, they have their own duties and are responsible for leading small formations such as squads and platoons. They also serve as sub-commanders and administrators under Officers in larger formations.

Specialist are highly trained experts in their fields. They typically serve as engineers, teachers, and researchers. Both Troopers and Sergeants may advance to Specialist.

Officers serve as command. Troopers and Sergeants may advance to Officer. Officers lead large formations such as Battalions, Brigades, and the Legion, providing both administration and governance alongside military command.

---

Exiles are those expelled from Dis Com society and their descendants. A Soldier convicted of a crime demeaned to disrupt unit cohesion, unbecoming of a soldier is sentenced to execution. immediately after sentencing, a mercy is placed on their sentence, Exile. their weapons are dulled, armor broken and ear notched, then they are expelled from their forts, never to return. if they ever even address a Soldier, the mercy of exile is forfeited and execution will be carried out immediately. As Such, Exiles live the rest of outside Dis Com society and integrate into whatever culture exist outside their forts. They may also self exile, to abandon their duties and leave Dis Com society by their own decision. their offspring are also born in exile, never to experience the life of a Soldier. it is highly recommended for those born in exile to have their ears notched, but are not obligated to do so. First Gen are those born as Soldier and were exiled later in life, they have live their entire life as a Soldier and now must adapt into something unknown to them. Second Gen are those born with one, if not both, First Gen parent, as such, will receive some exposure to a Soldier's culture thru their First Gen parents. Third gen don't have any first gen parents. they have little or no knowledge of Soldier culture

---

The Dis Com have various attire: Barracks Dress, Garrison Dress, Combat Dress, and Mess Dress.
Garrison Dress: Sage cargo pants, service coat, black boots with white or olive gaiters, and a sage patrol cap. Under dress includes short or long sleeve shirts and shorts, in black or olive.
Barracks Dress: A casual version of Garrison Dress. Service coat around the waist, untucked shirts and pants, no cap.
Mess Dress: Formal attire displaying medals and merits. Includes polished boots and gaiters, straight pants, belt, pressed coat, dress shirt, and garrison cap.

Their combat dress includes their garrison dress plus combat armor. The armor is particularly noteworthy. Their standard issue, medium-weight armor is considered highly effective, with only heavy armors from other groups being comparable. In contrast, Dis Com Heavy armor surpasses all heavy armor due to its robust defenses while remaining the lightest in its category. This is achieved through mastery of two manufacturing techniques. The armor plates are composed of composite ceramics treated in high temperature, high-pressure ovens. These plates are mounted on fatigues made of high-density, composite fiber weave. The helmet is made of the same material as the plates, providing high resistance, mobility, and low weight. Their light armor is the Combat Dress without the ceramic plates and is comparable to other medium armors.
Their heavy armor features thicker plates mounted on a thick, high-density body suit and a full head dome helmet. This design limits mobility but provides exceptional protection. The Dis Com heavy armor is highly resistant to various impacts, essentially making the wearer very formidable in the field. However, it requires a strong individual with significant stamina to effectively use the heavy armor, allowing them to be deployed similarly to tanks.

---

Their primary weapon is the Rifle.
[Meta Note: It is not an actual firearm; firearms do not exist in this fantasy world. The Dis Com rifle’s silhouette simply resembles real-world M16 and XM8 rifles. Instead of a barrel, it has a single-edged blade embedded in the handguard, along with a pistol grip and buttstock.]

Weapons in Threa fall into three damage categories: Slash, Pierce, and Blunt. Typically, a weapon excels in one type but performs poorly in the others — for example, spears have high pierce damage, fair slash, and poor blunt; clubs have high blunt but no pierce or slash. The Dis Com Rifle, however, provides good damage across all three categories.
[Meta Note: Again, the Dis Com Rifle is a melee weapon only — no ranged capabilities, no firearms. The firearm comparison is purely visual.]

The rifle consists of two parts: the carriage and the blade.

The carriage includes the buttstock, grip, and guard:

The grip is where the weapon is handled, influencing speed.

The buttstock adds mass and stability; it’s the part that deals blunt damage, impacting both speed and blunt. Roughened buttstock textures can enable critical blunt damage.

The guard adds mass and handling surface, further affecting blunt and speed. It also boosts defense and supports the blade, influencing reach.

The blade can come in various shapes, mainly affecting slash and pierce damage. Its length, supported by the guard, determines reach. Since the blade is embedded in the guard, it is a single-sided edge. The edge can be serrated for critical slash damage, or the tip may be hooked for critical pierce damage. Thicker, heavier blades enhance blunt damage, as does embedding the blade deeper into the guard. A wider guard can even support a second blade.

The carriage is typically made of hardwoods, compressed woods, softwoods for padding, and metals — especially for roughened buttstock surfaces. The blades are usually made of metal or ceramics, though stone can be used for lower-quality versions.

---

There are several variants of the Dis Com Rifle, each with distinct characteristics:

Standard Rifle — The basic design, featuring a blade that curves to a point.
Used as the baseline for all other variants.

Pistol Rifle — Essentially just the grip with minimal guard; no buttstock, and fitted with a short blade.
Commonly used as a sidearm.

Carbine Rifle — A shorter version of the rifle; it sacrifices reach for increased speed.
Can be dual-wielded, gaining a bleed effect when used this way.

Shotgun Rifle — A thicker, heavier carriage with a short guard; the blade is mostly embedded in the guard.
Can be dual-wielded, gaining extra stagger effects on blunt strikes.

Sniper Rifle — Features a longer, sturdier guard to support an extended, more sharply curved blade with a fine tip.
Delivers high critical damage and a boosted critical rate on pierce attacks.

Launcher Rifle — Primarily just the heavy carriage, with an extremely heavy buttstock and guard; the thick, heavy blade adds even more mass, with only a small edge exposed.
Preferred by Juggernauts, it delivers area splash damage and unblockable splash hits.

Type: Rifle - Weapon of Choice of the Dis Com.       
Description: The Rifle is a weapon that balances all three damage types. it is made of two major parts, the carriage and the blade. the carriage itself is made of the guard, the grip and the buttstock. The buttstock provides the blunt damage surface, the grip helps in maneuvering, while the guard provides defensive capabilities. the blade is embedded in the guard. it has a long edge for reliable slash damage, and it ends in a sturdy point for pierce damage.

## **Soldier Ranks**

### **Trooper Ranks**
  
Every soldier is born as a Trooper. They are raised in a Discipline Corps unit until they graduate — first in a **Training Unit** (until their late teens), then in a **Doctrine Unit** for four years. They are expected to graduate by early adulthood and begin active service — unless they wash out.
  
- **Recruit** (informally *Rookie*): Everyone in the Dis Com Legion is born a Recruit. This rank is retained until graduation. Anyone who has not graduated from the Doctrine Unit, including washouts, keeps this rank.  
- **Trooper** (informally *Grunt*): Initial rank upon graduation.  
- **Trooper First Class** (informally *Ace*): The next rank; some recruits graduate directly to this.  
- **Senior Trooper** (informally *Veteran*): A highly experienced Trooper.  
- **Lancer** (informally *Sham Sergeant*): Holds light leadership roles.  
- **Corporal** (informally *Gofer*): Veteran Troopers with more leadership, often the right hand to a Sergeant.
  
**Reserve Trooper** (informally *Senior Rookie, Chief Rookie, General Rookie*, depending on how long they’ve been a washout): If a recruit washes out, they are assigned to labor or honor units. They can retrain and graduate to Trooper if they choose. They continue annual basic combat drills. After two years without graduating, they are designated as reserves. If needed, they may be fielded in combat — though inferior to regular combat units, they are still on par with soldiers from other armies.
  
### **Sergeant Ranks**
  
Senior Troopers, Lancers, and Corporals can apply to become Sergeants. They are trained at the **Collegium**.
  
- **Cadet** (informally *Runt*): While training at the Collegium.  
- **Sergeant** (informally *Sarge*): Rank upon graduation; leads squads, with Lancers and Corporals as sub-commanders.  
- **Staff Sergeant** (informally *Lakey*): Next rank; cadets can graduate directly as Staff Sergeants. Sub-command to Captains.  
- **Lance Sergeant** (informally *Gofer*): Sub-command to Majors.  
- **Master Sergeant** (informally *Master*): Sub-command to Colonels.  
- **First Sergeant** (informally *Top*): Special assignment for Master Sergeants; leads a fort’s central command, under High Colonels.  
- **Command Sergeant** (informally *Lead*): Serves in supreme command, sub-command to Generals.  
- **Grand Sergeant** (informally *Boss*): Special assignment for Command Sergeants; they are the senior sub-commander directly under the Supreme General.

### **Officer Ranks**
  
Troopers, Sergeants, and Specialist of any rank can apply to become Officers. They only need to complete **Training**; they may skip the Doctrine Unit and go straight to the **Lyceum**, pending tribunal approval.
  
- **Plebe** (informally *Twerp*): While training at the Lyceum.  
- **Lieutenant** (informally *Junior*): Rank upon graduation; leads platoons (two or more squads), with Sergeants as sub-commanders.  
- **Captain** (informally *Cap*): Leads companies (typically four platoons), with Staff Sergeants as sub-commanders.  
- **Major** (informally *Striker*): Leads battalions.  
- **Colonel** (informally *Commander*): Leads regiments.  
- **High Colonel** (informally *Top*): Special assignment for a Colonel; leads a fort’s central command.  
- **Lieutenant General** (informally *Starlight*): Leads brigades (multi-fort formations), part of supreme command.  
- **General** (informally *Ranger*): Leads legions, part of supreme command.  
- **Supreme General** (informally *Boss*): Special assignment for a General; leads the entire Dis Com Supreme Command, and as such, The Dis Com Legion.

### **Specialist Ranks**
  
Experienced Troopers and Sergeants can advance as a Specialist. Their training is informal, overseen by the Discipline Corps, and done through apprenticeship rather than formal units.
  
- **Apprentice** (informally *Pupil*): A soldier under the mentorship of a technical officer.  
- **Technical** (informally *Chief*): Serves as an advisor at the company level.  
- **Expert Specialist** (informally *Expert Chief*): Serves as an advisor at battalion, regiment, and fort level; joins the Discipline Corps as a technical officer.  
- **Master Specialist** (informally *Master Chief*): Serves as an advisor to supreme command.

### **Non-Active Duty Ranks** (Retired, Dead, and Exiles)
  
- **Soldier-at-Rest** (*Legionnaire*, *Old Guard*): A retired soldier. Cannot advance in rank; instead, *-at-Rest* is added to their final rank (e.g., *Lancer-at-Rest*). They may assist in labor, agrarian, honor, and discipline corps but cannot be called to front-line duty.  
- **Soldier-at-Peace** (*Oathkeeper*): A soldier who has passed away or fallen in battle; their rank is amended with *-at-Peace* (e.g., *Lancer-at-Peace*).
  
**In summary:**  
The dead are called **Oathkeepers**;  
The living are called **WarFighters**;  
The exiled are called **HonorBreakers**.

Forts
Each fort operates as an independent city-state. They function autonomously, though materials, resources, and troops are regularly exchanged between them. Each fort is organized into various units, primarily combat forces, alongside several specialized units. Governance is handled by Central Command, made up of unit commanders up to the fort commander. Each fort is led by a High Colonel and their Master Sergeant. Central Command’s mission is to ensure the combat units stationed at the fort are always ready.

Above Central Command is Supreme Command, which oversees not just individual forts but also all inter-fort movements and coordination. Supreme Command governs the entire Dis Com network and is led by the Supreme General and their Grand Sergeant, stationed at The Citadel — the Dis Com capital.

Fort Types
Outpost
The smallest fort type, containing only essential operations. It hosts small corps units, including combat and command, with logistic and signal teams to stay linked with Supreme Command. Labor, mess hall, engineering, and medical units help keep combat forces focused. Outposts rely on larger forts or host states for support and are typically deployed for low-presence or temporary missions.

Garrison
A mid-sized fort with agrarian units for food production and support for larger combat forces. Garrisons house Training and Doctrine Units to develop local troops, as well as custodial, engineering, logistics, signal, Valor, Honor, materiel, forge, workshop, and loom units.

Bastion
Larger and more advanced than a garrison, bastions include expanded agrarian and specialized combat units, including mounted troops. They also feature Armory units for weapons and armor production, technical units for specialized training, and tribunal units. Bastions hold the lease for their own land and oversee dependent garrisons and outposts, making them fully self-sufficient.

Fortress
The largest and most fortified standard fort type, built by elite engineering teams and staffed with police units. Fortresses contain the densest concentration of combat units with various specializations, including Juggernaut training, alongside numerous technical, agrarian, labor, and armory units.

Stronghold (The Citadel, The Academy, The Sanctuary)
Even more fortified than fortresses, these strongholds serve as the pinnacle of Dis Com power. Though their combat forces resemble those of bastions, they lack extensive agrarian, materiel, loom, forge, and armory units, intentionally depending on support from bastions and fortresses. Instead, they house large concentrations of Valor, Honor, signal, and logistics units. Protecting the Sanctuary, the Academy, and the Citadel — in that order — is the absolute top priority for all Dis Com forces. Among these, The Citadel serves as the capital and seat of Supreme Command.

---

Units

- Teams: 2 Troopers. The highest ranking Trooper assumes command. Medic, Recon, Instruction, Logistics, Signal, and Armory Corps often use teams as their operational units — akin to partners, siblings, or couples.
- Squads: 2–4 teams; 1 Sergeant, 1 Lancer or Corporal, and 2–6 Troopers. Akin to families. This is the smallest operational unit for most corps. An outpost may house a single squad.
- Platoons: 2–4 squads; 1 Lieutenant, with squad leaders serving as sub-commanders. Some platoons consist of all one type of unit, while others have mixed units. Akin to extended families.
- Company: 2–8 platoons; 1 Captain, 1 Staff Sergeant. Akin to villages or towns. A garrison may house one company.
- Battalion: 3 or more companies; 1 Major, 1 Lance Sergeant. Akin to towns or small cities. Agrarian and Labor units are typically no larger than battalions. Bastions may house one battalion.
- Regiment: 1 or more battalions plus various support companies; 1 Colonel, 1 Master Sergeant. The smallest fully autonomous unit, capable of carrying out offensive campaigns. Akin to cities or capitals. Bastions and fortresses may house one regiment.
- Brigade: 2 or more regiments; 1 Lieutenant General or General, 1 Command Sergeant. Commands multiple forts, headquartered in a fortress, covering entire regions. Akin to states or provinces.
- Legion: Led by 1 Supreme General and 1 Grand Sergeant. Encompasses every fort and every unit — all active-duty Dis Com across all of Threa. Only once in history has the entire Dis Com marched as one. The current mission is to maintain the readiness and well-being of all Dis Com forts.

---

The Agrarian Corps is the second-largest corps, focused on food production. The Dis Com are exclusively vegan, so the Agrarian Corps harvests a wide variety of crops, with rice and corn as the primary staples. They also cultivate cotton for textiles, as well as supplemental crops such as wheat, oats, fruits, and vegetables, including medicinal plants. Additionally, they have a division dedicated to raising mounts for the cavalry divisions and supply corps, and they produce wool for textiles.

---

The Labor Corps performs various labor-intensive tasks. The Materiel Division handles lumber and mining, while the Forge and Workshop Division manages manufacturing. The Forge constructs tools and objects from clay and metals and refines these materials for the Armory. The Workshop crafts items from wood and prepares wood for the Armory. The Loom Division produces textiles such as garrison dress, underdress, mess dress, and other clothing accessories, as well as prepares materials for the Armory.

The Custodial Division handles cleaning and janitorial duties, including the Laundry Service, which cleans textiles like uniforms and linens. The Labor Corps also runs the Mess Hall, responsible for food preparation, service, and ration manufacturing. Rations are ready-to-eat meals provided to troops before or during deployment, eliminating the need for kitchens in the field.

---

The Engineer Corps is responsible for the construction and maintenance of buildings, forts, roads, carts, and carriages. Engineers are skilled in various repair, light construction, and machining tasks.

Jacks: Multi-skilled professionals capable of handling various engineering tasks, including basic construction and repair.

Wreckers: Specialists in demolition work, clearing and leveling land, and performing other earthworks.

Builders: Focused on constructing buildings, roads, and other infrastructure projects.

Masons: Experts in stonework and fortifications, including the construction of outer walls for bastions, fortresses, and capitals.

Mechanics: Handle the manufacturing and repair of carts, wagons, and other wheeled vehicles, as well as the construction of machines such as construction lifts.

---

The Armory is a specialized corps responsible for the production of weapons and armor. It is divided into three primary divisions: the Weapons Division, the Armor Division, and the Weave Division.

The Weapons Division crafts the Dis Com Rifle and its variants. The Armor Division manufactures ceramic plates. The Weave Division produces high-density composite textiles and the Juggernaut bodysuit.

The Armory operates independently from the Forge, Workshop, and Loom divisions to minimize the number of individuals with knowledge of the crafting processes for their armor and weapons. They are also the only ones authorized to repair Dis Com weapons and armor.

---

The Logistics Corps manages the logistics, transport, and distribution of supplies, materials, and personnel. They oversee operations within the fort, across various locations, and on the battlefield — nothing moves without their knowledge. They collaborate with the Agrarian Corps for field beasts of burden and with the Engineers for carts and wagons to build their transport fleets.

Every corps reports to the Logistics Corps regarding inventories, such as the amount of harvested goods, the number of shirts available, the rations on hand, and the destinations of lumber. Additionally, the Logistics Corps handles requests for supplies, materials, and personnel, ensuring these requests are fulfilled.

They also operate local supply stores, warehouses, and shops where soldiers can obtain personal supplies and rations. The Marketplace provides a space where soldiers can acquire personal items.

Warehouses: Large selections of items in a central location.

Shops: Smaller selections of items, often located closer to where soldiers are stationed.

---

The Signal Corps is responsible for all communications, managing requests and orders within and between forts, across battlefields, and to external locations.

The Liaison Division handles inter-fort communications and messaging with foreign states, including the state that owns the land on which a fort is situated. Liaison units frequently travel outside the forts, making them particularly knowledgeable about the world beyond the fort walls. They are trained to maintain secrecy during these travels and are often targeted by external states. Liaisons also maintain communication with exile communities. Some Liaisons have notched ears to blend in with exiles; however, their notches differ from those of true exiles so they can be recognized by the Signal Corps. If they fail to use proper channels, they risk summary execution.

Couriers are tasked with delivering orders from Command units to combat and support units, ensuring that orders are conveyed as quickly and securely as possible. They also handle message encoding and decoding.

Additionally, the Signal Corps operates the Post Office, which manages non-operational correspondence, primarily enabling soldiers to stay in touch with one another as they move between forts.

---

The Valor Corps handles both promotions and punishments.

The Police Division enforces laws and administers punishments, which can range from additional labor duties and incarceration to demotion, exile, or execution.

Sentries man the fort walls and serve as the first line of defense, holding the line until combat units can be mobilized.

The Tribunal is the division responsible for judging whether a soldier should be punished. It also oversees decisions on promotions and the granting of awards.

---

The Honor Corps is responsible for maintaining morale through recreation, entertainment, and ceremonies. They include athletes, performers, musicians, thespians, and bards, managing lounges, playgrounds, sports fields, and organizing events like promotions, funeral rites, command changes, and parades. Alongside the Labor Corps, they are a common placement for those unable to serve as Troopers.

---

The Recon Corps is responsible for intelligence gathering and includes cartographers, historians, vanguards, and forward observers. They also oversee covert units such as spies, infiltrators, and assassins. Recon units can be deployed to any fort, from outposts to fortresses, at the discretion of Supreme Command. Cartographers and historians work independently within forts, while vanguard and scout units support combat operations. Covert recon units are dispatched as needed, with their identities concealed and sometimes integrated into other units, such as agrarian teams.

---

Here’s the polished and corrected version:

---

The Discipline Corps is headquartered at **The Academy** and is led by a Lieutenant General and a Command Sergeant. It has four main divisions: **Training**, **Doctrine**, **Technical**, and **Crucible**.

- **Training Division:** Handles basic education. When a Dis Com soldier is born, they are assigned to a Training Squad where they learn reading, writing, mathematics, history, fitness, and other foundational subjects until their late teens.

- **Doctrine Division:** Focuses on combat and battlefield knowledge, weapons training, drills, discipline, readiness, and unit cohesion. Initial combat doctrine training lasts about four years. Upon completion, recruits become Troopers; before this, they are formally called recruits (informally, *rookies*). Training continues throughout their careers.

- **Technical Division:** Oversees specialist fields such as agriculture, engineering, and judicial roles (excluding medical training, which is handled by the Medical Corps). The training duration varies depending on the specialty.

- **Crucible Division:** Manages the training of Sergeants and officers. The **Collegium** trains Sergeants, while the **Lyceum** trains officers. Any Trooper can become a Sergeant, and any Trooper or Sergeant can become an officer.

---

All forts, except outposts, have Training Units. Fortresses and bastions also have Doctrine Units. Technical Units vary based on a fort’s needs — sometimes, one fort with Technical Units will train Specialists for neighboring forts. For example, while most forts have engineering units, a nearby fort might handle specialized engineer training. Outposts do not host any Discipline Units.

Soldiers trained in Technical Units may begin apprenticeships to become Specialists. They can continue serving as experienced soldiers within their units or join the Discipline Corps. While anyone can join the Discipline Corps, Specialists may join as instructors if positions are available. Instructor training takes place at The Academy. Once trained, instructors may be assigned as detachments to various forts, focusing on Training, Doctrine, or Technical Units. With sufficient experience, instructors may join The Academy’s permanent personnel.

Technical, Collegium, and Lyceum instructors must have field experience in the areas they wish to teach. Training and Doctrine instructors do not require prior experience to apply, although combat experience is preferred for Doctrine instructors. All instructors fall under the Academy’s supreme command.

Cadre Units
When a soldier is born, they are placed into a cadre unit — a small group of young recruits formed into squads soon after birth. Each cadre squad usually has two to four recruits, though it can hold up to six. Recruits may be of varying ages.

Two adult soldiers, usually Senior Troopers or junior Sergeants, are assigned as cadre leads to oversee the squad. They can refuse this assignment up to three times, but on the fourth, they are required to accept. These cadre leads continue to serve in their main units while caring for and guiding their assigned recruits.

Four cadre squads together are overseen by an officer and sergeant, making up the cadre command. Recruits first go through Training School, taught by a dedicated training unit, where they learn basic education like reading, writing, math, history, and fitness. After completing this phase, they move on to Doctrine School for four years of combat training and drills, overseen by a Doctrine Unit.

Training Units exist at all forts except outposts, so outpost cadres must travel to other forts. Doctrine Schools are only at bastions and fortresses, meaning garrison cadres also require transport. Some Doctrine Schools offer boarding; others have recruits commute.

After graduating from Doctrine School, recruits are promoted to Troopers and sent to their first posts, leaving the cadre. Those who fail to graduate are reassigned as Reserve Troopers, often placed in Labor, Agrarian, or Honor Units. Once all recruits leave, the cadre squad disbands, and the cadre leads are released from their responsibilities.

Cadre squads live together in special barracks, with cadre leads sharing the space. After disbandment, cadre leads can choose to continue living together or separate, at least until they receive a new assignment. Despite disbanding, it’s common for former recruits and their leads to stay in touch, supporting each other throughout their lives.

In Dis Com society, the cadre takes the place of family. Dis Com soldiers do not know their biological parents, siblings, or children — nor do they even understand those concepts. Instead, the cadre becomes their family unit: cadre leads act as parents, fellow recruits are siblings, the cadre command serves as grandparents, and other squads are like cousins, aunts, or uncles.

The academy has a central command, just like any other forts. Supreme command oversees the Discipline corps, responsible for educational and training activities across the legion. Central command manages the academy's infrastructure, services, and specialized units, ensuring maintenance, ration distribution, cleanliness, and protection. To ensure instructor quality, the academy does not train its own units but instead attaches units trained at various forts.
Using external units allows the evaluation of instructors to ensure the Discipline Corps is effectively fulfilling its mission. This evaluation is conducted in two ways. First, if the operations run smoothly, it indicates sound training. Since the attached units come from different locations and are unfamiliar with each other, they must rely on their training to accomplish tasks.
Second, supreme command submits requests to central command to observe how the units respond. For example, if a change in rations is requested, the management of this adjustment by agrarian units can be evaluated. If outcomes do not meet expectations, further investigation may be necessary to understand the reasons behind the actions. This insight can then be used to modify the curriculum.
The academy's units focus on maintaining operations so that the Discipline Corps can concentrate on their mission. They are not part of the Discipline Corps and do not fall under its direct command. Despite the capability to train their own units, the academy opts not to, so they can evaluate training at other forts through the attached units. The main function of these units is to sample the training occurring at various forts.

The Sanctuary serves as the headquarters for the medical corps, which independently manages its own instruction, logistics, tribunal, and signal needs. Soldiers wishing to join must be approved by the medical tribunal. To maintain secrecy, the medical corps has duplicate components under the guise of operational efficiency. The medical corps enforces a genderless society to promote comradeship by eliminating gender distinctions. Unlike other races that deploy single-gender armies, Dis Com can utilize their entire population. Medical units need to know patients' genders, so they remain isolated. Members of the medical corps are bound to stay once they join.
Outposts field a medic post, typically manned by a team of two medics. Garrisons have infirmaries, bastions have clinics, and fortresses have hospitals. The sanctuary itself also functions as a hospital. Hospitals are where soldiers are sequestered for procreation; the “Quarantine Division” is actually the maternity division. Soldiers sequestered for quarantine are informed that they have an illness requiring isolation. They are kept in individual rooms with low light. Males undergo induced symptoms similar to pregnancy, including inflammation, fatigue, vomiting, swelling, and painful deflation. Once the child is born, parents recover and then return to their units. Due to the consistent experience, isolation, and dim lighting, soldiers believe they were genuinely ill. After a few weeks of care, the child is sent to another fort and assigned to a cadre squad.
The Logistics Corps maintains a service file on each soldier, while the Medical Corps maintains separate medical and secret files containing the soldier's gender and lineage. This secret file is initially stored at the hospital where the soldier was born. After several years, both medical and secret files are moved to the sanctuary. Medics posts, infirmaries, and clinics may request the medical file if treating a soldier. The medical file may travel to any medical facility, but the secret file may only travel between hospitals and clinics. If an infirmary holds the medical file and a hospital retains the secret file, the facility with the secret file may request the medical file to be returned.
In addition to instruction, logistics, signal tribunal, and 'quarantine' divisions, the medical corps includes divisions specializing in various medical practices:
Medics: General knowledge of medicine, capable of practicing and being deployed anywhere, primarily in field medicine. At least two medics are required for a medic post.
Doctors: General medicine practitioners who treat most cases, typically found in the rear of battlefields, infirmaries, clinics, and hospitals.
Surgeons: Specialists in severe injuries, commonly found in clinics and hospitals, and sometimes deployed in the rear of the battlefield.
Alchemists: Creators of potions, tinctures, salves, and other remedies, usually stationed in clinics and hospitals, and occasionally deployed at the battlefield rear.
Stewards: Caretakers of retired soldiers or those unable to continue due to medical reasons, exclusively found in hospitals and not deployed.
Nurses: Assistants to all medical specialists except for medics. Technically, one of the two medics—the junior soldier—assumes the tasks of the nurse, while the senior soldier assumes the roles of doctor, surgeon, or alchemist.

If a soldier discovers their gender, they may exhibit unusual behavior, disrupt the peace, and jeopardize unit cohesion. Such actions are considered unbecoming of a soldier. In response, the authorities will detain the individual and refer them to a valor tribunal. If the valor tribunal suspects a case of gender discovery, the matter is escalated to a medical tribunal. Upon confirmation of gender discovery, the individual is sentenced to execution, which essentially means exile.
A significant number of exiles result from decisions made by medical tribunals, not solely due to gender discovery. Medical personnel, who are aware of their own gender, might engage in relationships. Medics are strictly prohibited from pursuing romantic relationships or becoming romantically involved. However, some romances do occur, potentially leading to complications. As these relationships threaten unit cohesion, those involved are subjected to execution (exile). Some couples may choose self-exile or deliberately seek execution to live together outside the society.
Medical soldiers, for any infraction, are immediately referred to medical tribunals without the involvement of valor tribunals. The higher incidence of exiles within the medical corps, attributed to breaches of unit cohesion, is used by supreme command to justify maintaining the policy of unknown genders. This approach continues to be endorsed due to incidents where individuals prioritize personal relationships over their duties and societal responsibilities.

Valor Tribunals and Medical Tribunals possess the authority to sentence soldiers. The range of penalties that can be imposed includes reprimand, labor, incarceration, demotion, and execution.
Reprimand is a verbal action, either private or public, aimed at shaming the individual. Labor involves temporary reassignment to a Labor Unit, typically in Custodial units. this option is not available to Medical Tribunals, as Medical Soldiers cannot leave the medical Corps. Incarceration entails removing the individual from their unit and jailing them for a period of time. Depending on the length of incarceration, they may be reassigned to a labor unit upon release. Demotion reduces their rank; Officers and Sergeants may be demoted to Trooper if their rank is sufficiently low. Execution results in the termination of the individual's life without any honors. However, upon being sentenced to execution, they are granted a mercy known as Exile. Their armor is broken, their rifle is dulled, and their ears are notched before they are expelled from the fort, never to return. Exiles are forbidden from communicating with any Militant Dis Com. If an exile even greets a Militant Dis Com, they forfeit their mercy, and any present Dis Com has the authority to carry out their execution.
The armor is broken and rifles dulled to show mercy, as the exiled will face the unknown. They keep their armament for better survival chances. However, pristine armament is valuable outside and could be used against Dis Com or replicated. By damaging them, this risk is reduced. Even in a damaged state, exiled armament matches common gear, but without access to a Dis Com Armory, it can't be repaired.
Exile communities help each other navigate life outside the Forts. New generations born outside can choose to notch their ears. Few attempt to engage with Dis Com Soldiers, often leading to their demise.

The struggles faced by exiles vary depending on their generation. First-generation exiles were born as soldiers, raised within the confines of the Legion, but are now permanently disconnected from everything they have ever known. They understand that approaching a Soldier Dis Com is not an option, as they once held similar positions and would not hesitate to eliminate an exile.
Second-generation exiles, on the other hand, were born outside the Dis Com soldier society and experience aspects of the soldier lifestyle only through their first-generation parents. Frequently, they choose to notch their ears at the request of their parents.
Third-generation exiles, who also are born outside, have parents with minimal knowledge of soldier society. Often, they opt to go unnotched, mistakenly believing they can infiltrate Dis Com Forts and accomplish something significant. However, upon discovery, they are executed. Without the guidance and emphasis from the first generation to avoid contact with soldiers at all costs, they tend to approach soldiers, ultimately leading to their demise.

The Command Corps serve as the leadership of the Dis Com and their administrative staff. There are three divisions: Supreme Command, Central Command, and Orderlies. Supreme Command oversees operations across the entire legion, including Combat, Signal, Logistics, The Armory, and Recon units. Central Command manages the maintenance and operations of individual forts, overseeing Agrarian, Labor, Engineering, Valor, and Honor units. The Orderlies division encompasses the support staff responsible for clerical work, scribing, labor, and other duties in service of command officers.
Central Command operates under the authority of Supreme Command. While the Supreme Command may consider input from Central Command, it is the duty of Central Command to execute the orders given by Supreme Command to the best of their ability. For instance, should the Supreme Command require a new building, they will submit a request to Central Command. Central Command will then evaluate the request and provide an assessment, after which the Supreme Command will issue their orders. To construct the building, Central Command must mobilize engineers. If all engineers are currently assigned to critical tasks and cannot be reassigned, and if nearby forts cannot supply engineers within the requested timeframe, the Supreme Command has two options: they can either agree to a delay or order the reassignment of engineers to the new building project, accepting any consequences that arise from disregarding Central Command's recommendations. The Citadel may subsequently review these actions and consequences and take disciplinary action against the Supreme Command if necessary.
In times of emergency, central assume command over supreme, Central may direct its own combat units. Alternatively, central may relinquish its command over to supreme, for supreme to use the forts support units directly. Still, it is better for central to assume command and supreme to take advisory roles

Academy unit rotations are managed according to different fort rotations based on unit type. The central command of the Academy assesses its needs and, if two agrarian companies are required, they will send a request to the next fort in the rotation for agrarian units. The central command of the requested fort will evaluate their units and send back an evaluation. If the fort can fulfill the request immediately, they will do so without evaluation. If only part of the request can be fulfilled, they will send what is available along with their evaluation. If the request cannot be fulfilled immediately, only the evaluation will be sent. The Academy will review the evaluation if their request was not met. They may order the fort to fulfill it regardless or send a new request to the next fort in the rotation for the remaining units.
The requested fort has the discretion to choose any of its units to meet the request. They may operate with reduced ranks until their attached units return or request the training of new units. Units attached to the Academy are there temporarily, stationed for two to four years. Afterwards, they may request an extension to stay, return to their previous fort, or be stationed at another fort.

---

The academy and sanctuary supreme command act as extensions of the main supreme command at the citadel. Each fort has its own supreme command detachment. The Lieutenant Generals at the academy and sanctuary report to the Supreme General at the citadel but enjoy more autonomy compared to other corps based at the citadel.

---

A challenge is that the Academy is fairly protected and isolated, far from any frontline. This tends to lead their instructors and supreme command to deviate from a practical approach in their curriculum and adopt more hypothetical approaches, resulting in units being improperly trained. These units may face significant risks due to their sub-par training. The citadel typically addresses issues with these instructors.

---

All corps, except for instruction and medical, are headquartered at the citadel under supreme command. Logistics, Signal, and Recon have a greater presence there, subordinate to supreme command. Agrarian, Labor, and Engineer have a lower presence and are led by colonels and Master Sergeants, still under supreme command but mainly reporting to each fort's central command. Valor and Honor corps have the smallest presence, each led by a Major and Lance Sergeants, nearly autonomous from supreme command but not from central command. Each fort may have its own laws, awards, celebrations, and festivities that are managed by the Valor and Honor Corps. Combat Corps is directly commanded by supreme command.

---

The Combat Corps is the largest corps in the Legion, with every fort hosting combat units. The mission of every forts is to ensure the readiness of these units. The divisions within the Combat Corps include:
Infantry: The majority of combat units are infantry. Troopers may be assigned to an infantry unit upon graduation as their initial assignment. When not actively deployed, they continuously participate in training exercises.
Cavalry: Cavalry units utilize mounts raised by agrarian units.
Siege: These units operate siege machinery created by engineer units, such as rams, towers, ladders, and catapults.
Blitz: Blitz units consist of light infantry wearing light armor to enhance speed and mobility, and are equipped with carbine rifles.
Juggernaut: Heavy infantry units, known as Juggernauts, wear a body suit that provides significant defense for the wielder.

Recon units can support combat units with extra capabilities, such as cartographers for map details and vanguards for scouting. Covert units may also integrate to achieve further objectives.
