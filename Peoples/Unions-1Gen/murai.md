# Murai

In the World of Threa, there are 21 races. This is a description of a race that lives in the world of Threa, the Murai. That I will describe

---

The Murai are Warrior society. each person has a role not just during times of peace, but also during war

---

on there appearance, their skin color ranges between pale and dim reds and purples, their hair and eye color are deep reds, dark reds. with rare oranges and golden yellow. they have a receding hairline. their hair clumps into five points, one on top of their head and two on each side.  they may style their hair using those five points. like cutting the top point, or tying two adjacent points together. they have pointed ears. because of their active lifestyle, it is common for them to have lean, muscular build.

---

each Murai has a dual role, one relating to peacetime, know as Concord, and the other relating to wartime, know as Discord.  The labor class in Concord are the main infantry class in Discord. the merchants deal with logistics. the administrators and governors form the command structure during Discord. scribes and poets in Concord, carry orders and communication duties. artisans serve as armorers

---

of particular note is their armor. Second only to Dis Com Heavy armor. Murai armor comes in three grades. each is defined by the amount of skill needed to wield it and the amount of Azure metal used. Azure is a precious metal. similar to Gold, with the difference being that Azure is blue, not yellow. its use in any armament seems perplexing because as a soft metal, it will easily deform from being hit. This is were the skill of the Murai comes into play. Murai know how to imbue items with lifeforce. Murai can then use this lifeforce reserve to enhance their own properties, becoming faster, stronger, harder. The can use the lifeforce to tank more hits.Azure metal can gold more lifeforce than any other material.  Valiant grade armor has minimal use of Azure, relying more on hard metals like iron and steel. Victor grade armors have around 50 percent azure, allowing the warrior to have acces to a larger reserve of lifeforce. it also has increase coverage of the body. Noble grade armors are nearly entirely made of Azure metal. their bodies are fully covered, giving them the highest reserve of lifeforce possible

---

Part of maintaining their armor is to restore any expended lifeforce. the easiest way is to pour blood onto the armor. and it is even easier if the wielders own blood is use. The wielder taps into the lifeforce already within the blood and transfers it into the armor. it is more effective if the wielder uses their own, familiar blood and lifeforce, than someone else. but they can still extract some nonetheless. they typically slit their wrist and let about one third of their blood flow unto the armor. this leaves the wielder weak and must recover. the wielder can repeat the session until the armor is full. a depleted armor is considered dead and will take more blood than otherwise in order to revive it.  Skilled wielders can transfer the lifeforce straight into the armor, without using blood as the intermediary. They can also use the lifeforce of their opponent if they draw their blood. it would not be as efficient but it is a helpful skill.

---

Murai maintain two sets of clothing. their Concord cloth is what they wear every day. Commoners use sturdy materials for their shirts, coats, hats, pants and boots. Nobles use finer materials with intricate decorations for their shirts, coats, hats, pants and boots. females may also adorn their hair with ribbons. their Discord cloth is their armor. they maintain it during Concord so it will be ready to wield when Discord starts.

---

Murai are egalitarian. there are few impositions placed upon the individual based on their gender. any and all role are available to anyone as long as they can demonstrate their capabilities.

materials used for armor and weapons.
Iron: a basic metal, has a dull grey color
Blacked Steel: a type of steel that has been hardened. it has glossy black. it is like glass. it is very tough, and will fracture rather than deform. and it is formed when liquid or molded in a cast.
White Steel: a form of steel that is hard to craft. has a white luster. highly flexible
Azure: a soft metal with a blue luster. it is used as a vessel for lifeforce.
in order to make the azure usable for making armor and weapons, it is alloyed with the other metals.
iron - azure alloy. it is a crude, mass produces metal, with low azure content, little to no temperature control. it comes out in a variety of vibrant colors. the ingot can come out either green, red, pink, yellow, purple or even a slick rainbow luster . it is slightly softer than regular iron

the colors are based on the temperature and azure content. but since they are forged in a crude manner, they are basically random. if they would be willing to refine the process, they can get the exact color they want. like the Iridescent rainbow is cause by large temperature fluctuations. Maybe they were forging in a windy day and someone didn't close the door.

azure - blacked steel alloy: it is done with more care than Azure - Iron. it is a dark blue to deep blue in color. it can flex before it cracks. and it flexes, so it returns back to its shape, like spring steel. but not as tough like blacked steel.

Azure - White Steel alloy: it has pastel blues in color. it is more precise in its manufacture, maintain very high temperatures, place the right amounts of iron sand and azure powder in the charcoal forge, to dust the precise amount of azure powder in the correct layer.  it has a higher azure content. it is superior than white steel. it is tougher, more flexible, just heavier.

---

Valiant armor is mass produced by Artisans. they use traditional armor techniques, with iron a. by itself, it would make a decent light armor. but on the upper limit of weight to be classed as light armor. and also less coverage than other light armors. Lifeforce can be stored on the iron, but not much. thou even with this amount, is enough to be able to lighten the armor, so the weight penalty is minimized. That is just without the Azure metal. but with the azure - iron alloy used, the armor can hold between to fifth to one thirds of an average person's lifeforce.



Victor Armor are crafted with greater care than Valiant armor. it uses less blacked Steel and its azure alloy. it has more detailing, that is used to hold more Azure, that can be personalized. these armors can hold between one third and half a persons life.  it sits in the middle in regards to medium armors  

---

Noble grade armors are more complex, intricate and provides the most coverage. specially commissioned by it wearer, it can take a year or more to craft. it uses blacked steel, white steel, their azure alloys and pure azure itself. a complex frame, a scaffolding of sorts made of white steel. the joints and bolts are reinforced with blacked steel. its azure alloys can be used as substitutes, at the artisans discretion. a wire mesh of blacked steel fills the voids in between the frame. this mesh probide the attacment points for plates made of azure - white steel alloy and of pure azure. additional detailing is made of those two materials on top of the plates.  this maximizes the amount of azure that can be used on the armor, while still function as an armor. it is classed as a heavy armor. it can store between half an average person's life force up to twice the amount

---

Bringing the Armor to life. once the armor is crafted, it will be its wielder that brings it to life. the murai may prepare for a week, being well fed and hydrated, before performing this ritual. they can stand, sit or kneel in front of their armor. their armor is arranged in the manner of their liking, but it all must be connected. they will meditate for a while, to get a feel of their own lifeforce and feel the azure in the armor. then they will cut open their wrist and place their arm over the armor, letting the blood slowly drip on the armor. they must remain like so for hours, typically scheduled for sun up till mid day, or mid day till sunset. it must be a slow drip so that the lifeforce in the blood can penetrate the azure as efficient as possible. it must be steady and uninterrupted, otherwise it may risk damage, lifeforce blockage. They may have assistants to help them monitor their progress, like their spouse, parents or children.
it is about one third of their blood that must drip on the armor, too little and it may not hold, it will empty out, to much and it may break. to finish, they place their hand on the helmet, by tradition but it can be any part of the armor. if they can feel their lifeforce in the armor, they have been successes full, and will seal it. the armor is now alive, it has been born. at this point the wielder would be weak, they would be pale. they will bandage their wrists to stop the bleeding. the best course of action is to don the armor. their assistant may help with this. once they fully don their armor, they can use the lifeforce to help them heal. if they are for some reason unable to don their armor, they would be need to be tended to for them to recover.
if something wrong happens, if the assistant believes that the wielder life is in danger and cant complete the ritual. they can stop it. in order to prevent damage because of the premature end. the assistant is to cut themselves and pour their blood in the armor to seal it. it can be cleanse later and the ritual retried once the wielder has recovered.
if a part of the armor was not connected, then the lifeforce would not have flowed into it, as if it wasn't part of the ritual at all. this would have a diminished lifeforce capacity. they may attempt later, and it would still require the one third of blood for that one piece.
this process can be done alone, but it carries even more risks


---

in order to prevent damage because the of the incomplete ritual. someone else had to pour their lifeforce in order to seal it. this is needed to prevent, for example, leak, blockages or clogs. leak is when lifeforce constantly drains, blockage is when there is lifeforce that cant be used, and clogs can result in inconsistent flow. if it was left unsealed, any of these problems could arise. since someone else sealed it. there are two different lifeforces in the armor. since the armor is still not alive, it cant be used effectively. the lifeforce that it has would need to be burned off. that is to say that it needs to be used up. the easiest way is for both to touch the armor and burn off their respective lifeforces, that is to say to use the lifeforce for nothing. it is just being consumed without doing anything. once it is drained, an artisan inspects the armor for physical damage and repairs any. once that is done, and the wielder has recovered, they can try again . it is possible for one to do the clensing, but handling someone else's lifeforce is harder than one's own. so it runs the risk of accidentaly leaving some lifeforce that might end up damaging it when the ritual is retried.

---

The weapon of choice for the Murai are Shields. efective uses can deal high amounts of blunt damage, while further bolstering the armors defenses. Murai Shields are mounted on the armor's bracers. Murai Shields come in variety of shapes, but by far the most common shape ends in a point in front of the hands. some varieties have embedded blades. one in particular is the sparing shield. it is large and heavy round shield. Its increased defense is meant to protect the wielder during sparing session, and its heaviness hinders mobility. some however have found that with training, Sparing Shields can be used effectively in combat. especially it can provide ranged capabilities since it can be thrown like a disk.

---

Humble and Noble refer to their station, their job. if they are farmers, fishers, artisans, merchants, etc, they are humble. noble stations deal with governance and administration. Governors, scribes, scholar, clerk, judges etc.
then are the ranks Soldier, Warrior, Knight and Lord

---

lets say a humble farmer, they train in their martial prowess as the cultivate the land. at one point, they are sworn, and become warriors, and receive their Warrior rank armor. now that they are sworn. they can be elevated to be a humble mayor or still remain a humble farmer. their increase in honor can lead them to be knighted and receive a knight rank armor. at which they may advance, if the wish to be a noble governor. further honor and they are lorded, with a Lord rank armor. at which point they may advance to be a noble lord.

if they ever serve in Discord before being sworn as a humble warrior, are humble soldiers, and wear a base armor. 

a Noble Lord/ Lady can be elevated to a Noble ArchLord/ ArchLady   

then there is an enlighten one.  unlike everyone else. this one is born in this station. this one is mentored, trained to embody the pinnacle of their ways.  Chivalry/ bushido

---

the armors are referred as cloth. and are referred by the rank, soldier cloth, warrior cloth, knight cloth and lord cloth. on the weight class system, with higher weight tends to mean higher defense but lower mobility: Soldier and Warrior Cloth are light armors, Knight Cloth are medium armors and lord cloth are heavy armors. the ArchLord cloth is heavier, and the enlighten one being the heaviest.

---

Cloths are made of a number of materials, one very important is Azure. it is like gold, but blue. the important property of Azure Metal is that it can hold the most lifeforce. The Murai master the ability to control lifeforce (Qi, Chi, Cosmos, vitality, aura) The Murai can pour lifeforce into the armor, with the azure content of the armor absorbing the bulk of it. so the armor serves like a reservoir of lifeforce they can use to enhance themselves. 
Soldier Cloth has no azure in it, so it is not even worth to pour lifeforce into it. they can, but dont.
Warrior Cloth has  small amounts of Azure metal, enough to store between 1/3 to 1/2 of an average persons life force.
Knight Cloth has more Azure content. it can store about 1/2 up to 1 persons worth of life force
Lord Cloth has a lot of azure. can hold between 1 to 2 persons worth of life force.
a basic technique is to use that additional lifeforce to enhance one own strength and speed, effectively negating the weight class of the armor

materials used. 
leather, cotton, brass: used for the various fasteners and buckles

Iron: a basic metal, has a dull grey color 

Black Steel: a type of steel that has been hardened. it has glossy black. it is like glass. it is very tough, and will fracture rather than deform. and it is formed when liquid or molded in a cast. it is basically hardened glass

White Steel: a form of steel that is hard to craft. has a white luster. highly flexible . essentially katana steel

Azure: a soft metal with a blue luster. it is used as a vessel for lifeforce. 

Since Azure is a soft metal, it is useles as armor. in order to make the azure usable for making armor and weapons, it is alloyed with the other metals.

iron - azure alloy. it is a crude, mass produces metal, with low azure content, little to no temperature control. it comes out in a variety of vibrant colors. the ingot can come out either green, red, pink, yellow, purple or even a slick rainbow luster . it is slightly softer than regular iron
 
the colors are based on the temperature and azure content. but since they are forged in a crude manner, they are basically random. if they would be willing to refine the process, they can get the exact color they want. like the Iridescent rainbow is cause by large temperature fluctuations. Maybe they were forging in a windy day and someone didn't close the door.
 
azure - black steel alloy: it is done with more care than Azure - Iron. it is a dark blue to deep blue in color. it can flex before it cracks. and it flexes, so it returns back to its shape, like spring steel. but not as tough like blacked steel.
 
Azure - White Steel alloy: it has pastel blues in color. it is more precise in its manufacture, maintain very high temperatures, place the right amounts of iron sand and azure powder in the charcoal forge, to dust the precise amount of azure powder in the correct layer.  it has a higher azure content. it is superior than white steel. it is tougher, more flexible, just heavier.

Soldier Cloth: Leather and Iron
Warrior Cloth: Iron and Azure Iron Alloy
Knight Cloth: Black Steel and Azure Black Steel Alloy
Lord Cloth: Black Steel, Azure Black Steel Alloy, White Steel, White Steel Azure Alloy, and pure Azure

---

a bit of clarity on black steel. i am imagining like glass. while it is molten, it can be shaped, blown, twisted, stamped, molded. but once it cools, basically just surfacing, polishing, sanding. if struck by a hammer, to like curve it, it will either resist the deformation and spring back to the original shape, or crack. 

---

Azure is soft and heavy. Making it actually a bad material for use in armor. Being heavy, it limits mobility. Usually this is a tradeoff for increased durability. But because it is soft, it can't handle many blows before it fails. Worn by anyone else, they make for abysmal armors, except for the Soldier Cloth. In fact, if all the azure content was removed. Just black/white steel and iron, no alloys or pure azure, the armors would be lighter and more durable. But with a lifeforce user, Murai armors are much more performant. 

---

Soldier Cloth is basically iron plates held by leather.  They are mass produced by artisans. so quality is functionally minimal  

Warrior Cloth is also mass produced by Artisans. It basically a Soldier Cloth with azure/iron alloy used instead of iron in many parts. The variety of colors allow some level of customization. Some may want their set to be one color, other want every part to be different color. they have the most color variety.

---

Knight cloth. are crafted with greater care than Warrior Cloth. it uses black Steel and its azure alloy. it has more detailing, that is used to hold more Azure, that can be personalized. it has more covarage than soldier and warrior cloths. it has a glossy black with deep blue accents look

---

Lord cloth are more complex, intricate and provides the most coverage. specially commissioned by its wearer, it can take a year to craft, by a team lead by a master armorer. it uses black steel, white steel, their azure alloys and pure azure itself. a complex frame, a scaffolding of sorts made of white steel. the joints and bolts are reinforced with black steel. its azure alloys can be used as substitutes, at the artisans discretion, since the alloys are slightly inferior in terms of structure but add to the capacity. a wire mesh of black steel azure alloy fills the voids in between the frame. this mesh provide a bit additional capacity and additional attachment points for plates made of azure - white steel alloy and of pure azure. additional detailing is made of those two materials on top of the plates.  this maximizes the amount of azure that can be used on the armor, while still function as an armor. ArchLord armor adds a plated cape that uses Azure, and white steel azure alloy, adding 1/2 a person more. The Enlighten one has azure wires woven in their clothing, in addition to an archlord class armor cloth. in the padding, stitches. this is a complaxe process that further adds 1/3 more of capacity.  
These are azure blue, with pastel blues and white. it is as full coverage as possible.

Bringing the Armor to life,
When an armor cloth is crafted, be it Warrior, Knight or Lord, (and technically also Soldier), it is still not alive. its wielder would need to bring the cloth to life. the Murai may prepare for a week, being well fed and hydrated, before performing this ritual. they can stand, sit or kneel in front of their armor, or whatever position they want, they just have to be able to hold it for hours. their armor is arranged in the manner of their liking, but it all must be connected. any disconnected parts might well just not be there at all. they will meditate for a while, to get a feel of their own lifeforce and feel the azure in the armor. then they will cut open their wrist and place their arm over the armor, letting the blood slowly drip on the armor. they must remain like so for hours, typically scheduled for sun up till mid day, or mid day till sunset. it must be a slow drip so that the lifeforce in the blood can penetrate the azure as efficient as possible. it must be steady and uninterrupted, otherwise it may risk damage, lifeforce blockage. They may have assistants to help them monitor their progress, like their spouse, parents or children.  
it is about one third of their blood that must drip on the armor, too little and it may not hold, it will empty out, too much and it may break. to finish, they place their hand on the helmet, by tradition, but it can be any part of the armor. if they can feel their lifeforce in the armor, they have been successful, and will seal it. the armor is now alive, it has been born. at this point the wielder would be weak, they would be pale. they will bandage their wrists to stop the bleeding. the best course of action is to don the armor. their assistant may help with this. once they fully don their armor, they can use the lifeforce to help them heal. if they are for some reason unable to don their armor, they would need to be tended to for them to recover.  
if something wrong happens, if the assistant believes that the wielder life is in danger and can't complete the ritual. they can stop it. in order to prevent damage because of the premature end. the assistant is to cut themselves and pour their blood in the armor to seal it. it can be cleansed later and the ritual retried once the wielder has recovered. 
if a part of the armor was not connected, then the lifeforce would not have flowed into it, as if it wasn't part of the ritual at all. this would have a diminished lifeforce capacity. they may attempt later, and it would still require the one third of blood for that one piece.
this process can be done alone, but it carries even more risks. 
it is because of this high cost, that is pointless to bring Soldier cloth alive. without azure content, its reserves are minuscule. but some have tried and succeeded. with just enough lifeforce to negate the weight of the helmet

---

Overfilling it may cause damage to the armor. Beyond its capacity, the armor may swell and develop fractures and loose structural integrity. this can be repaired, but it takes additional maintenance, that at the very least, is expensive. thou it is a strategy, to overfill the armor, to carry more lifeforce, and deal with the armor repair latter. thou it does come at the risk of killing the armor.

---

Armor Death: Once the armor becomes alive, it must possess lifeforce. If this lifeforce is completely exhausted, the armor dies. Dead armor is more fragile than its materials. Since the armor negates its weight during use, the full weight becomes a hindrance once lifeforce is lost. Unrepaired structural damage can cause fouling; when the lifeforce is gone or blocked or clogged, the armor is considered dead. During combat, the armor absorbs some of the blows through its lifeforce, which causes depletion. A sufficient number of blows can drain the lifeforce and kill the armor. If the armor receives a blow too heavy to absorb, it may crack, resulting in leaks or bleeding, which causes continuous depletion. The armor can draw lifeforce from opponents or from the wearer, who may also be bleeding during combat, to sustain itself. Once the armor dies, its materials no longer effectively hold lifeforce, even if reforged. The ritual of awakening will not work on these materials. Usually, dead armors are discarded in graveyards, though they may sometimes be revived.

---

dead cloths are often discarded. sometimes buried with honor. the material is reforge into an heirloom. sometimes some of the material is reforged with new material into a new armor. the dead material is dead weight in the new armor, but it is mostly symbolic and sentimental. the dead materials encased in amber resin to protect the brittle parts. but it is possible to revive it. there are two ways. both start with physical repair of the armor, as best as possible. the more material of the original armor present, the the greater chance of success. because the material is brittle, it may crumble to dust before it is repaired. 75 percent or better have the best chance of successes. but at whatever state, it may be revived in two ways.  
the first is to leave it undisturbed in a place where there is a lot of life force flowing, like in a dense forest, in a lake, waterfall, on top of a high peak . it must remain undisturbed for a very long time. could be years, even decades before the armor revives. the ambient lifeforce slowly repairs the armor. if its original wielder may pass away before the armor revives. It may become lost. Also it could be passed down to a descendant that is alive when the armor revives.  
the second is much faster. it is like the ritual of awakening, but with half of one's blood, not just a third. it could be anyone, but at least half of a single person's blood is to be drained, and not a slow drip, but it must flow, drench the armor. this will place the person in a medical emergency. immediate medical attention, or they may not survive.  The person is to flow their lifeforce into the dead armor, as such. It cannot be completed from an enemy by drawing their lifeforce. And the person must be alive when the last drop hits the armor. Not many can survive with losing one third of their blood, much less with loosing half.  
once the armor is revived, it is weak, and must be repaired, like replace missing material. before it can be used. 

---

Transfer cloth: while it has minimal practicality, it is symbolic and social.   
once an armor is alive, anyone can wield it. but it is easier to do so the more familiar the new wielder is with the life force stored. parents, siblings, children tend to be the most familiar after one's own. it is not because they are related, but because they have spent a long time exposed to their life force. a longtime friend would be more familiar than a long lost twin. as such, transferring armors to them is no issue. but the passing of armor ritual is still held. Only the receiver would cut their hand and place it on the armor. the wielder would also place their hand uncut. the wielder would burn off lifeforce in the armor, and the receiver would pour their lifeforce into the armor. there is no set amount. they may only do so a little or the full third.    
this is purely symbolic. as the receiver, especially a familiar one, can already use the life force inside. if anything, the receiver can burn off the lifeforce in the armor and then pour their own. thou the more unfamiliar, the more necessary it is. so even if its to someone familiar, it is still done, just in case.

---

to be clear, what Murai call lifeforce, is actually Eura. the primordial essence of Threa. without going to deep, the particular "shape" that Eura takes in living sentient being, is what the Murai manipulate. most others, that can wield Eura, use ambient Eura, external source. the murai use "internal" Eura, "shaped" by their existence, not the formless ambient Eura

---

The weapon of choice of the Murai is the Shield. it is not a defensive shield, thou Murai Shields are good for defense too. Marai Shields are for attacking. 
One shield can be mounted on each bracer, so two shields tend to be wielded. The basic shield has the shape of a ship's hull. It besides increased defense; it deals high blunt damage and medium pierce damage. a variant ends in a rounded bulb, rather than a point, forgoing pierce damage for increased blunt damage. Another variant has blades attached, providing slash damage. Wolverine claws. There is a large circular variant that maximizes defense, and a smaller circular with a chain that can be thrown.

While they could add azure, it’s better not to. Unlike armor, which absorbs blows while the wielder can dodge to avoid them, the shield both takes and delivers attacks. This means any lifeforce reservoir would drain quickly, causing the shield to die.

The Murai are an egalitarian meritocratic Theocracy. Whichever station one is born, one can advance or recede as they choose, as they can prove. each station is important, from a humble farmer, to a noble lord. While they enjoy peace, they seek out war. 

In each Murai Realm, there is one, selected from their birth, or close enough, to embody all that is good. To one they go to war for, to defend and protect, the one above all, the enlighten one

note, they are warmongers. The Lor and Aria are their common targets. The Lor are expansionist, so they naturally clash with them. The Aria are not, but hold a fair amount of territory.  The Ma Hir are fiercely territorial of their waters, and may test them on their coasts and lakes. they also do incursions into Minka Jungles to disrupt their wargames. The Murai are the only ones not to have a protection agreement with the Dis Com, and eagerly clash with them. everyone ease in Threa are to weak for them, it would bring no honor in defeating them, yet, they serve as good warm up. they seek conflict with the strongest people to test themselves against. the vast Lor armies, the arial tactics of the Aria, maritime battles with the Ma Hir, unusual tactics of the Minka, and the prized Dis Com, a true test of their skills.

---

to expand a bit more. but this is beyond the scope of this discussion, as it will cover things that the Murai dont know.

The Lor are not a unified people. most are not expansionist, but there are expansionist lor kingdoms. the murai dont make a distinction. while the expansionist Lor may meet them in open field, or their doorstep. the murai may be on a retaliatory mission and target a non expansionist kingdom. Most of the Lor aren't well skilled, conscripted peasants, thou there occasional skilled veterans. The lor are the most populous people on, and their armies vast, from hordes to professional formations. for the Murai, they feel they can just "cut loose"

The Aria live in fortified flat mountains and in cloud cities. their unassailability is enticing to the Murai. breaching their fortifications. because of their fortifications, the aria do not maintain a large army, the Thunders. while well trained, the strength of the aria military are not their thunders, the their zephyrs, the covert branch of Aria military, assassins, espionage, sabotage, etc. The Murai do not know the Zephyrs exist, and can comprehend how Thunders keep besting them.

The Ma Hir are an underwater people, and claim most fresh water territory in Threa. they are fiercely territorial, even among themselves. Ma Hir domain tend to be at war among each other more often than not. most landwellers dont challange Ma Hir claims. however, the Murai do. while most skirmishes are alonge the shore, some do dare go underwater and fight Ma Hir on the terms.

The Minka are isolationist, they keep in their jungles. part of their culture are War Games, they go to war amongst themselves for sport. Minka tribes fight each other during War season, but will fiercely unite against intruders, like the Murai tend to do. 

The Dis Com see themselves as a peacekeeping force. they are fully militarized. while they have no land of their own, their Forts can be found across Threa. each fort has pacts of defense, in which they will fight along side their ally. this is done in hopes to deter conflicts, as the Dis Com keep a strong military force. No Murai Realm holds such pacts with the Dis Com. in fact, they may pick fights with their weaker allies to mobilize an entire fort. The Dis Com military prowess is renowned and would even consider it an honor to fall against them

[Meta: a core design principle for the Murai is Dark. they are the people of Darkness. This doesn't mean evil, rather focus on the self, in contrast on focus on others. While the people of the light are altruist, the Murai, people of the Dark, are Egoist. while there are positives, they are reflective, Self improving, self sufficient, that if they fail, it is but their own fault. thou they are also selfish, self centered. how the other peoples of Threa are for their own test, their own measure, irrelevant for the suffering they may cause. They may pick a fight with a Lor Honor guard, just to see if they are skilled enough to best the Lor, not caring about the widow they may leave behind. or even to provoke a Dis Com Fort, which can withstand a Murai siege. but if the attack a neighboring Redn farm under Dis Com protection, with just pitchforks as armaments, the the Dis Com would open their forts and render assistance, the real fight the Murai are hoping. They are not evil, but it is harder for them to have empathy toward others.   ]

Deep in Murai territory, in their realms (Realm is the term for their nations. Like Lor Kingdoms, Ma Hir Domains and Dis Com Forts.), it is quite peaceful, especially in concord times. with diligent workers, gracious Lords, it is common to see murai meditating, practicing flowing techniques, breathing. they also train their martial arts. armorers crafting Discord Cloth. Crime is very low, as there are harsh penalties for even minor offences. Think of a samurai, or a monk, under a cherry blossom tree. 

in contrast to outside, how others see them. instigators, picking fights, the cruelty they leave behind, for nothing. it not because they have been insulted, nor because someone wrong them, to defend the weak, nor to intimidate, to impose, to take, to conquer.  just because (according to other) they can and nothing more. they are strong, skillful, imposing, and terrifying. if one calls you out to fight, best fight with all your might for a chance to get out with your life.
