# Jin

In the World of Threa, there are 21 races. This is a description of a race that lives in the world of Threa, the Jin. That I will describe

---

The Jin are an egalitarian farming people. they control vast farmland. secretly, they are masters of covert arts

---

on their appearance. the Jin have light yellow skin. their hair and eyes are sky blue in color. Their height ranges between 5 and 6 feet in height. because of their lifestyle, they tend to have slim and athletic builds. they wear padded shirts and padded pants, in various shades of light grey or light bluish grey. Their footwear tend to be browns and oranges. they wear various wraps around their bodies. They aim to have asymmetrical styles. maybe one arm is sleeveless, maybe on leg has bandages, maybe the other sleeve is detached.They also have large yokes and bandanas, in blues and reds

---

what other may not realize is that their regular clothing also doubles for combat use. The thick cotton padding is able to absorb a fair deal of blows before it need to be replaced. and since cotton is one of the crops they farm, they have plenty of this resource. another aspect is that they soak their garments and wraps in concentrated brine. once the liquid evaporated, thick crystals form, embedded in the fibers. this significantly boost the defensive capabilities of their clothing.

---

During mission that require the utmost proficiency. They can wear Master Shadow outfit. it is similar to their regular clothing, more deliberate in its construction. Thicker padding in some areas for increased protection, thinner in other for increasing mobility. The crystal growth is carefully monitored, such as a hardened noncrystalline plate forms. a thicker yoke to protect the head, and the use of bandana and hood to conceal their identity. the asymmetric aesthetics are drop in order to maximize coverage.footwear is made of soft, silent leather. The entire outfit is dyed in midnight blue to easily conceal themselves at night.

---

The Jin live in coveted land. some are placated by making their resources available thru trade. other hope to conquer them. The Jin hold that they would not be able to go head to head against a well armed, well trained army. as such, they use covert operations to slow or prevent their enemies from directly attacking them. 

---

Their main operatives are the Shadows. Jin Shadows are akin to real world ninjas. Jin Shadows are blended with the general population. Not all jin are shadows, but it is very hard to tell them apart. jin shadows are posted everywhere, paying attention on what is going on. if action is required, they can investigate, infiltrate, steal, bribe, lie and misdirect. if something requires more force, a Master Shadow may need to be involved. They can additionally, spy, kidnap, interrogate, assassinate, blackmail and other forms of forceful negotiations. The Jin have also gain some leverage on other state, by stealing various state secrets and court intrigue that they would prefer to be kept private. the jin also make additional revenue by contracting out their Shadow operatives.

---

A Shadows weapon of choice are tonfas. they have blunt non lethal, and bladed lethal variant. since they are also good as a general purpose tool, just about everyone has a tonfa.

---

Besides their covert operations, Jin are good farmers and merchants. They grow crops and raise animals not just for themselves, but for nearby populations. they tend to be referred as the breadbasket of their region. They also contract out other forms of resorse extraction to other, like lumbering and mining. they do act towards sustanable aproches, reather than exploitative.
