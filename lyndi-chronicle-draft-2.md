# Lyndi's Chronicle

---

## Act 1: Start of Rounds – Action Tutorial (Hidden Quick Action)

**Scene Setup**

- The screen fades in from white, panning down to reveal the area in front of the head nurse’s office in a hospital.

**Narrative**

- Lannet startles Lyndi, causing her to drop her clipboard.
- Lannet picks it up and hands it back to Lyndi.

**Prompt**

- After Lannet picks up the clipboard and begins handing it back, she says: *“Here, take it.”*

**Action**

- The player presses the action button to grab the clipboard.

**Struggle**

- If no action is taken, Lannet prompts: *“Press the action button and take it.”*

**Fail**

- If Lyndi doesn’t grab the clipboard, Lannet shoves it into her hands.

**Hidden Tutorial**

- Before Lyndi is startled, a quick action prompt appears.
- If pressed in time, Lyndi retains her composure instead of dropping the clipboard.

**Hidden Element**

- This functions as a hidden quick reaction tutorial.
- As soon as the scene fades in, Lannet approaches Lyndi from behind and startles her.
- This causes the clipboard to fall unless the quick reaction prompt is used.

> **Impact on Lannet**
>
> - **Increased Frustration**
>   - Lyndi is startled (fails the quick action).
>   - Lannet shoves the clipboard into Lyndi’s hands (fails the action tutorial).
> - **Increased Respect**
>   - Lyndi retains her composure (quick action success).

## Act 2: Walk to the First Room – Walk Tutorial

**Narrative**

- Lannet tells Lyndi to follow her.
- They both walk to the first room.

**Prompt**

- *“Follow me.”*

**Action**

- Use the control stick to move Lyndi and follow Lannet.

**Struggle**

- If Lyndi doesn’t move, Lannet prompts: *“Tilt the left joystick and follow me.”*

**Fail**

- If Lyndi still doesn’t move, Lannet grabs her hand and drags her to the first room.

> **Impact on Lannet**
>
> - **Increased Frustration**
>   - Lannet has to drag Lyndi to the first room (fail walk tutorial).

---

## Act 3: Clean the Room – Action Tutorial

**Narrative**

- Lyndi and Lannet enter a room with eight empty beds.
- Lannet cleans the four on the left, while Lyndi is assigned the four on the right.
- They take the charts and pick up/place the pillows on the beds.

**Prompt**

- Lannet says: *“I’ll take the four on the left, you take care of the four beds on the right.”*

**Action**

- Tap the action button to pick up and place pillows.
- Hold the action button to take charts.

**Struggle**

- If Lannet has finished two of her beds and Lyndi has not completed at least half her tasks, she prompts:
  - *“Press the action button to grab and place things. Long press to pick up the charts.”*

**Fail**

- After Lannet finishes her side, she will complete any unfinished tasks on Lyndi’s side.

> **Impact on Lannet**
>
> - **Increased Frustration**
>   - Each bed on Lyndi’s side that Lannet has to finish.
> - **Increased Respect**
>   - Avoiding the struggle state (Lyndi keeps pace with Lannet).

---

## Act 4: Mr. Kendri – Dialog Tutorial

**Narrative**

- Lyndi and Lannet enter the next room, which has four patients—two on the left and two on the right.
- Lannet instructs Lyndi to take the two on the right while she handles the two on the left.
- One of Lyndi’s patients is asleep and only requires a chart update.
- The other patient is Mr. Kendri. Lyndi and Mr. Kendri exchange pleasantries, and Lyndi ensures he is taken care of.
- Once both sides are complete, Lyndi and Lannet leave the room.

**Prompt**

- Lannet says: *“I’ll handle the left side, you take care of the rest.”*

**Action**

- Tap the Dialog button near Mr. Kendri to initiate conversation.

**Struggle**

- If Lyndi has not spoken to Mr. Kendri by the time Lannet finishes with her first patient, she prompts:
  - *“Tap the Dialog button to talk to your patients. Hold to think carefully about how you speak to them.”*

**Fail**

- After finishing her side, Lannet completes any unfinished tasks.
- If Lyndi is still talking to Mr. Kendri, Lannet interrupts and politely ends the conversation.

**Additional**

- If Lyndi checks Mr. Kendri’s chart before speaking to him, he initiates the conversation.
- Lyndi may also wake the sleeping patient, but the patient will be annoyed.

> **Impact on Lannet**
>
> - **Increased Frustration**
>   - Each bed on Lyndi’s side that Lannet has to finish.
>   - If the conversation with Mr. Kendri drags on and Lannet interrupts it.
>   - If Lyndi wakes the sleeping patient.
> - **Decreased Frustration**
>   - Avoiding the struggle state.
> - **Increased Respect**
>   - Avoiding the struggle state.
>   - Speaking with Mr. Kendri beyond the minimum *“How are you feeling”* without taking so long that Lannet must interrupt.
>   - Talking to Mr. Kendri before checking his chart.

---

## Act 5: The Ward – Practice

**Narrative**

- Lannet and Lyndi arrive at the ward, a large open room with 60 beds organized into 4 rows.
- Not all beds are occupied—there are 40 patients in total. From left to right, the rows contain 13, 8, 10, and 9 patients.
- Two veteran nurses are present:
  - **Flannie** – the focus nurse.
  - **Wilma** – the warmth nurse.
- They instruct Lannet and Lyndi to help check on the patients.

**Row Selection**

- There are two center rows and two outer rows.
  - If Lyndi picks a center row, Lannet takes the other center row.
  - If Lyndi picks an outer row, Lannet takes the closest center row.
- If Lannet has to pick first:
  - If Lyndi is closest to Wilma, Lannet picks one of the left rows (outer left or center left).
  - Otherwise, she picks one of the right rows.
  - If Lannet’s frustration is low, she chooses the row with the most patients on that side.
  - If her frustration is high, she chooses the row with the fewest patients.
- For the veteran nurses:
  - The nurse closest to Lyndi takes the nearest row according to her trait.
    - Wilma takes the row closest to Lyndi.
    - Flannie takes the row closest to Lannet.
  - The remaining nurse takes the last row.

**Prompt**

- A veteran nurse says: *“So you are the two new nurses helping with rounds today. You two can check one row.”*

**Action**

- Check charts and talk to patients.
- Patients may make requests (e.g., getting water, telling a joke), which Lyndi can choose to fulfill or refuse.

**Struggle**

- If Lannet has passed her fifth bed and Lyndi has not reached hers:
  - If Lannet is in an adjacent row, she prompts: *“Just check the charts and check the patients, keep things moving.”*
  - If Lannet is not in an adjacent row, a veteran nurse intervenes:
    - Flannie (closest): *“Pick up your pace, dear.”*
    - Wilma (closest): *“Keep your rhythm up, sweetie.”*

**Fail**

- After finishing her row, Lannet goes to Lyndi’s row and completes any unfinished tasks, commenting: *“Hurry up, Lyndi!”*

**Veteran Nurses (Flannie & Wilma)**

- At the end, Flannie and Wilma notice the dynamic between Lannet and Lyndi.
- One comments on **focus**, the other on **warmth**.
- Whichever nurse finishes first delivers her comment.
- Both are faster than Lannet, but the difficulty of their rows determines which one finishes first.

*If Lannet has to help finish Lyndi’s row, the comment is about Lannet:*

- **Flannie on Lannet**
  - Neutral: *“You’re focused. Lyndi can learn something from you.”*
  - High Frustration: *“You’re pushing hard, but you need to watch your stress levels, Lannet.”*
  - High Respect: *“You always give it your best, Lannet. Your focus never falters.”*
- **Wilma on Lannet**
  - Neutral: *“Your touch is a bit cold. You need to warm up to your patients.”*
  - High Frustration: *“You’re efficient, but it’s showing in your demeanor. Patients can sense your stress.”*
  - High Respect (subtle): *“You handled things well today, but remember that a little warmth goes a long way.”*

*If Lannet does not finish any of Lyndi’s row, the comment is about Lyndi:*

- Flannie: *“Your focus is spot on. You two make a great team.”*
- Wilma: *“Your smile brings warmth to your patients.”*

**Lane Switching**

- If Lyndi switches rows before completing her own:
  - Lannet: *“Finish with your patients first.”*
  - Wilma: *“Don’t worry about me, sweetheart, handle your patients.”*
  - Flannie: *“Go back to your patients, dear.”*
- If Lyndi finishes her row first before switching, no comments are made—she is simply helping at that point.

> **Impact on Lannet**
>
> - **Increased Frustration**
>   - Each bed Lannet has to finish in Lyndi’s row.
>   - Lyndi switching rows before completing her own.
>   - Lyndi finishing her row before Lannet and helping out (Lannet feels pressured by the comparison).
> - **Decreased Frustration**
>   - Avoiding the struggle state (whether from Lannet, Flannie, or Wilma).
> - **Increased Respect**
>   - Fulfilling patient requests.
>   - Finishing her own row.
>   - Lyndi switching rows after completing her own (showing initiative, even if it frustrates Lannet).

## Act 6: Going Upstairs – Hidden Subtle Dialog Tutorial

**Narrative**

- After finishing in the ward, Lyndi and Lannet head to the stairwell and begin walking up to the second floor.
- During the ascent, a subtle dialog prompt appears, indicating that Lyndi has something to say.
- Holding the dialog button to bring up the ring menu is the only way to engage in this hidden conversation.

**Conversation Start**

- Lyndi: *“Lannet, why aren’t we friends?”*
- Lannet: *“What are you talking about?”*

**Replies**

*Frustration Replies*

- “You never share anything about yourself. It’s like you’re always in a rush to get the job done.”
- “Back at school, you always kept to yourself. It felt like you didn’t care about anyone else.”
- “You’re always so cold to me and everyone else. Do you even care about your patients?”
- “It’s hard to work with someone who never wants to get along, Lannet.”

*Somber Replies*

- “We’ve been through a lot together, Lannet. I thought we’d be closer by now.”
- “At the hospital, it just feels like there’s a distance between us, and I don’t know why.”
- “I’ve tried to get to know you since we started nursing school, but it’s like there’s a wall.”
- “I sometimes wonder if I did something wrong, or if you just don’t like me.”

*Reflective Replies*

- “I remember how focused you were during training. I always admired that, but I wish we could have bonded more.”
- “We both went through the same challenges in nursing school. I thought that would bring us closer.”
- “You’re incredibly good at what you do. I just wish we could connect beyond the tasks we do here.”
- “Maybe I haven’t made enough of an effort. But I want to understand you better, Lannet.”

**Lannet’s Reactions**

*Frustration*

1. Glares at Lyndi.
2. *“Shut up.”*
3. *“Stop being nosy.”*
4. Stops, right hand balls into a fist and shakes briefly; resumes walking in silence.

*Somber*

1. Looks down silently.
2. *“Stay focused.”*
3. *“Don’t worry yourself.”*
4. Stops, crosses her arms, stays silent briefly, then resumes walking.

*Reflective*

1. Takes a deep breath.
2. *“I…”*
3. Closes her eyes briefly.
4. Hands at her sides; glances down, then looks up and resumes walking.

**Outcome**

- Regardless of choices, once they leave the stairwell, Lannet ends the conversation:
  - *“Focus, we still have work to do.”*
- Dialog then reverts to normal behavior (Lyndi: *“Hey Lannet”* → Lannet: *“Not now”*).

**Conversation Mechanics**

- **Default Behavior**
  - Tapping the dialog button = Lyndi greets, Lannet dismisses (*“Not now”*).
  - Each attempt increases Lannet’s frustration.
- **Subtle Prompt**
  - Without the subtle prompt, the ring menu only shows **Greet**.
  - With the prompt, the menu unlocks *“Lannet, why aren’t we friends?”* to start the hidden sequence.
- **Reply Selection**
  - After Lannet says *“What are you talking about?”*, the menu shows three replies—one from each category (Frustration, Somber, Reflective).
  - After one reply is chosen, a new set of three unused replies appears.
  - Once all four replies from a category are used, that category is removed from the menu.
  - Not all replies can be accessed in a single playthrough; multiple playthroughs are required to see everything.
  - The aim is for a novice player to use three replies, and for an expert player to use up to five.
- **Player Uncertainty**
  - The categories (Frustration / Somber / Reflective) are hidden from the player.
  - To the player, lines appear as natural dialog without systemic labels.
  - They won’t know which emotional track is escalating.
- **Stutter Mechanic**
  - Only active during this conversation.
  - Tapping (instead of holding) causes Lyndi to stutter.
  - Lannet: *“What?”* → increases frustration.
- **Exit Option**
  - Menu includes *“Never mind.”* → decreases frustration and ends the conversation.

> **Impact on Lannet**
>
> - **Increased Frustration**
>   - Selecting frustration replies.
>   - Tapping the Dialog button without holding (stuttering).
>   - Repeated greetings outside the subtle prompt.
> - **Decreased Frustration**
>   - Not engaging in the conversation.
>   - Selecting somber replies.
>   - Ending the conversation with *“Never mind.”*
>   - Selecting all four Frustration replies plus one other reply.
> - **Increased Respect**
>   - The first Reflective reply.
>   - Selecting all four Reflective replies.
>   - Selecting all four Frustration replies.

## Act 7: Private Rooms – Advanced Tutorial

**Narrative**

- Lyndi and Lannet arrive at a hallway on the second floor with six doors—three on the left, three on the right.
- These are private rooms reserved for important individuals.
- Lannet is responsible for the three rooms on the right.
- Lyndi is responsible for the three rooms on the left: Mr. Roth, Ms. Liya, and Mr. Gregor.

**Prompt**

- *“You will check on Mr. Roth, Ms. Liya, and Mr. Gregor on the left.”*

**Action**

- Hold the action button to knock on a door.
- Hold the dialog button to announce yourself.
- Tap the action button to enter.

**Struggle**

- Before Lannet enters her first room:
  - If Lyndi simply taps the action button (barging in), Lannet says:
    - *“Hold the action button to knock, and hold the dialog button to announce yourself next time.”*
  - If Lyndi waits, Lannet demonstrates proper etiquette by knocking and announcing herself before entering.
- Once Lannet has entered, or if Lyndi follows proper procedure, no struggle occurs.

**Fail**

- Fail states are defined individually for each private room encounter.

**Rooms and Individuals**

- **Act 7.a** – Mr. Roth
- **Act 7.b** – Ms. Liya
- **Act 7.c** – Mr. Gregor (with multiple possible outcomes)
- **Act 7.d** – Aftermath

> **Impact on Lannet**
>
> - **Increased Frustration**
>   - If Lyndi fails to knock or announce herself before entering.
> - **Decreased Frustration**
>   - If Lyndi waits for Lannet’s demonstration or follows proper procedure without prompting.

### Act 7.a: Mr. Roth

**Narrative**

- Mr. Roth is a wealthy donor to the hospital. There is nothing seriously wrong with him; he is essentially taking a “vacation” to get away from it all.
- He is cheerful and welcoming.
- The bare minimum is to check his chart and ask if he is feeling well. All other interactions are optional.

**Initial Interaction Responses**

- **Barges In** – *“Well, that was quite an entrance, Nurse. Ever heard of knocking?”*
- **Knocks Only** – *“Ah, come in, Nurse. No need to be shy.”*
- **Announces Herself** – Lyndi: *“Mr. Roth, it’s Nurse Lyndi.”*  
  Mr. Roth: *“Ah, Nurse Lyndi! Come in, come in. Glad to see you.”*

**Patient Interaction**

- **Mr. Roth’s Position** – He is lying comfortably on his bed.
- **Chart Update** – Tap the action button on his chart to update it.
- **Dialog with Mr. Roth**
  - Tap dialog: *“How are you doing?”*
  - Hold dialog: *“What can I do for you?”* → He lists two tasks at first.
  - There are five tasks total, unlocked one at a time by asking *“Anything else?”*
  - After the fifth task: *“Nothing more, I am ready for today.”*
  - Departure:
    - Tap dialog: *“That is all for now then, Mr. Roth.”*
    - Hold dialog: Departure line at any time.

1. Adjust the Pillows – Requires long press to adjust properly.
2. Fetch a Newspaper – Lyndi brings and places it on his side table.
3. Bring a Glass of Water – Must pour carefully and walk slowly.
4. Open the Curtains – Long press to pull, or jump + action to reach the rope.
5. Tidy Up the Side Table – Long press to clean, then dispose of rubbish.

**Ring Menu**

- Action ring: context options such as **Open**, **Knock**, **Adjust**, **Take**, **Give**.
- Dialog ring: *“How are you doing, Mr. Roth?”*, *“What can I do for you?”*, *“Anything else?”*, *“That is all for now, Mr. Roth.”*, plus bonus *“Are you enjoying your vacation, Mr. Roth?”* → opens a cheerful branch.

**Conversation Branches**

- In the vacation branch, Lyndi can choose up to three replies.
- Mr. Roth responds warmly, sharing anecdotes. The conversation ends naturally or if Lyndi leaves.

**Dog Barking Reaction**

- If Mr. Gregor passes while Lyndi is with Mr. Roth, barking interrupts.
- Mr. Roth comments jovially: *“That Rolla is making a ruckus.”*
- A new dialog option appears: *“Excuse me, Mr. Roth.”* → Lyndi excuses herself and leaves for Gregor’s room.
- If Lyndi ignores it, Roth continues normally.

---

### Act 7.b: Ms. Liya

**Narrative**

- Ms. Liya is not wealthy or influential, but she was once a nurse at the hospital.
- She volunteered in the war effort, where she lost her leg, and is now wheelchair-bound while recovering.
- The hospital administrator placed her in a private room as a gesture of gratitude for her service.
- Like Mr. Roth, she has five tasks for Lyndi, which are given one at a time.

**Initial Interaction Responses**

- **Barges In** – *“You know, Lyndi, a little courtesy goes a long way.”*
- **Knocks Only** – *“Come in, Lyndi. You don’t need to be shy.”*
- **Announces Herself** – Lyndi: *“Ms. Liya, it’s Nurse Lyndi.”*  
  Ms. Liya (smiling warmly): *“Lyndi, come in. It’s always nice to see you.”*

**Patient Interaction**

- **Ms. Liya’s Position** – On her bed, with her wheelchair beside it, opposite the door.
- **Chart Update** – Tap the action button on her chart to update it.
- **Dialog with Ms. Liya**
  - Tap dialog: *“Did you sleep well, Ms. Liya?”* → focuses on her well-being.
  - After helping her into her wheelchair: *“If I may ask, how did you lose your leg?”*
  - After the window moment: *“Do you miss being a nurse?”*
  - Each topic offers one reply at a time, ending naturally when exhausted, when Lyndi departs, or if she leaves the room.

**Tasks**

1. Get Her Shawl – Retrieve and place over her shoulders.
2. Bring Water – Same sequence as Mr. Roth: pour carefully, walk slowly, hand it to her.
3. Help Into Wheelchair – Place wheelchair, then long press action to assist.
4. Take Her to the Window – Grab wheelchair and move her to the window.
5. A Moment of Reflection – Ms. Liya closes her eyes, breathes deeply, and reflects. Lyndi simply stands by and listens.

**Dialog Ring Menu**

- *“Did you sleep well, Ms. Liya?”*
- *“If I may ask, how did you lose your leg?”* (after wheelchair task)
- *“Do you miss being a nurse?”* (after window moment)

**Dog Barking Reaction**

- If Mr. Gregor passes while Lyndi is with Ms. Liya, barking interrupts.
- Ms. Liya remarks: *“Mr. Gregor’s dog sounds upset. Maybe you should check on him.”*
- A new dialog option appears: *“Excuse me, Ms. Liya.”* → Lyndi excuses herself and leaves for Gregor’s room.
- If Lyndi ignores it, Ms. Liya resumes calmly, but the option remains available.

---

### Act 7.c: Mr. Gregor

**Narrative**

- Mr. Gregor is a wealthy banker with a strong personality. He recently suffered a heart attack and is recovering.
- Stubborn and headstrong, but more reflective since the incident.
- He sits in a wheelchair with his dog (female) at his side.

**Door Etiquette — Initial Interaction Responses**

- **Barges In** → Mr. Gregor frowns: *“Do you make it a habit of not knocking, Nurse? A little respect goes a long way.”*  
  If Lyndi asks *“How are you feeling today, Mr. Gregor?”* at this point, he refuses to answer until she exits and re-enters with **Knock → Announce → Enter**.
- **Knocks Only** → *“Come in, Nurse. Next time, don’t be afraid to announce yourself.”*
- **Announces Herself** → Lyndi: *“Mr. Gregor, it’s Nurse Lyndi.”*  
  Mr. Gregor softens: *“Nurse Lyndi, thank you. Come in.”*

**Patient Interaction**

- **Position** – In wheelchair with dog at his side.
- **Chart Update** – **Tap** action on the chart to update.
- **Dialog Flow**
  - **Tap Dialog** – *“How are you feeling today, Mr. Gregor?”*
  - **Hold Dialog** – *“What can I do for you today, Mr. Gregor?”*
  - He provides tasks; Lyndi can ask **“Anything else?”** to surface more.
  - After his final task for the day: *“Thank you, Nurse. That will be all for today.”*
  - **Departure** – **Tap Dialog** → *“That is all for now, Mr. Gregor.”* (also available via **Hold** any time).

**Tasks**

*Two sets: core needs first, then extra requests.*

**First Set (Core Needs)**

1) **Fetch Medicine and Water** — *“Could you get me my medicine? …and a glass of water.”*  
   Lyndi retrieves the medicine, pours water, and hands both to him.
2) **Adjust Footrest** — *“My footrest is uncomfortable.”* → **Hold** action to adjust the wheelchair footrest.
3) **Fetch a Blanket** — *“I’m a little chilly.”* → Retrieve and place the blanket over him.
4) **Take Him to the Window** — *“I’d like a better view.”* → Push the wheelchair closer to the window.
5) **Open the Curtains** — *“Would you open the curtains a bit more?”* → **Hold** to pull; or **Jump** to reach the rope then **Tap** action to pull.  
   *Flavor if jump used:* *“You certainly make up for height with enthusiasm, Nurse.”*

**Second Set (Extra Requests)**

6) **Close the Curtains a Bit** — *“Actually, it’s a bit too bright now.”* → Adjust curtains.
7) **Reposition Wheelchair** — *“Back near my side table.”* → Move him back.
8) **Clean the Side Table** — *“It’s a bit cluttered.”* → **Hold** to tidy and dispose of rubbish.
9) **Fetch a Flower from Outside** — *“There’s a flower I’d like from that tree.”*  
   - **Fulfill** – Go outside, **Jump** to shake the branch, collect the fallen flower, bring it to him.  
   - **Promise** – *“I’ll take care of it for you.”* (completes the task immediately).  
   - **Extra Dialog** – *“Why do you want the flower?”* → *“The dog likes it.”*
10) **Fetch a Book** — *“Could you grab that book? I feel like reading.”* → Hand him the book.

**Additional Conversations**

- **After Curtains** — *“Mr. Gregor?”* → opens a reflective branch about his heart attack and what it meant to him.
- **Dog Interaction** — **Tap** action to pet the dog; unlocks *“What’s her name?”* → he shares a short hunting anecdote.  
  If that prompt is missed, Lyndi may default to *“So you are a hunter.”* leading to a similar branch.

**Etiquette Consequences**

- If Lyndi **barges in**, Gregor refuses to continue until she exits and re-enters with **Knock → Announce → Enter**.

#### 7.c (Mn): Full Interaction — Has Not Passed

- Gregor is still alive while Lyndi is with him. The player may complete as many or as few tasks as desired.
- The next act can begin without Gregor passing; he may pass later (e.g., during Act 8, off-screen).
- This path mirrors Roth/Liya structurally (long-form bedside care).

#### 7.c (Pr): Passing — Present *(Hidden Character Agency Tutorial)*

**Trigger**

- Gregor’s passing is scheduled on the world clock (running since Act 1). If Lyndi is in the room (or turns toward him within her vision cone) when it happens, she witnesses it.

**Death Beat**

- Whatever he is doing or saying, he slows, lowers his head, exhales one last time, and goes limp in the wheelchair.  
- Moments later, the dog moves to him, licks his hand, whimpers, nudges, then begins barking.

**Character Agency Sequence**

- Lyndi becomes unresponsive to input.  
- On the first bark: *“Mr. Gregor?”* She turns toward him, then: *“Mr. Gregor!”* She drops what she’s doing, rushes to him, kneels, and begins crying.  
- **Recovering Control** — Player mashes to help Lyndi regain composure. Initially no visible effect; after several attempts she mutters lines like *“I have to pull myself together…”* or *“Mr. Gregor needs help…”* and control returns.  
  If the player stops early, she slumps and resumes crying until input resumes.

**After Regaining Control**

- Lyndi wipes her tears; objective: find the doctor on the second floor.

**Lannet’s Arrival**

- Lannet reacts to the barking regardless of her current task, enters Gregor’s room, checks his pulse, then:
  - If Lyndi is still crying and Lannet’s frustration is **low**: she consoles Lyndi and restores control; they search together.
  - If Lannet’s frustration is **high**: she yells *“Lyndi!”* and goes to find the doctor alone (does not restore control).

**Doctors Arrive**

- When the doctor and team arrive, if Lyndi is still crying, the shock snaps her out of it (control restored).  
- The doctor orders Lyndi and Lannet to leave; the room becomes blocked.

#### 7.c (Ab): Passing — Absent

**Global Cue**

- Gregor passes while Lyndi is elsewhere on the second floor. The dog’s bark is audible in the hall and all private rooms.

**Other Patients React**

- If with **Mr. Roth**: *“That Rolla is making a ruckus.”*
- If with **Ms. Liya**: *“Mr. Gregor’s dog sounds upset. Maybe you should check on him.”*
- A new Dialog option appears to excuse herself: *“Excuse me, Miss/Mister.”* (polite exit).

**Entering During Barking**

- If Lyndi enters Gregor’s room before Lannet arrives: automatic line *“Mr. Gregor, are you okay?”* → seeing him still, she cries *“Mr. Gregor!!”* and briefly snivels.  
  **Short Agency** — any button press restores control.
- If Lannet enters and finds Lyndi sniveling, she calls *“Lyndi!”* which snaps her back (control restored).

**Ignoring the Bark**

- Lyndi may choose to ignore it and continue elsewhere; Lannet will investigate on her own, find Gregor, and go for the doctor.

#### 7.c (Dr): Passing — Doctors Present

- Lyndi arrives after Gregor has passed and as the doctors are already inside the room, pronouncing and preparing the body.  
- If Lyndi tries to enter, they block her and inform her of his passing.  
- **Short Agency** — Lyndi covers her mouth in shock; Lannet, the doctors, or two quick button presses restore control.  
- Lannet signals to keep moving, leading to the next act.

#### 7.c (Em): Passing — Room Empty

- Too much time has passed; Gregor has already been taken to the morgue.  
- **Room State** — the dog remains inside, anxious but no longer barking. Lannet does not investigate further since the barking has stopped.  
- **Subtle Prompt** — Inside the empty room, a quiet prompt appears; Lyndi may select *“Where did he go?”*  
- **Mandatory** — collect the chart.  
- **Departure** — upon leaving, Lannet signals Lyndi to continue to the next act.

**Additional Rule**

- If Mr. Gregor passes, any uncompleted tasks are ignored and omitted from the report due to the emergency. Lannet does not finish them.

---

### Act 7.d: Aftermath

**Narrative**

- Private Rooms conclude. Lyndi and Lannet regroup in the second-floor hall.
- If Mr. Gregor **passed**, his door is blocked as staff handle the room.
- Regardless of outcome, they descend via the **main stairs** to continue rounds on the first floor (transition to Act 8).

**State Resolution**

- **If Mr. Gregor did not pass during Act 7 (7.c Mn):**
  - No special restrictions; normal hallway flow.
  - Any unvisited/optional interactions on this floor can be deferred to Break.

- **If Mr. Gregor passed during Act 7 (7.c Pr / Ab / Dr / Em):**
  - Mr. Gregor’s room remains closed to Lyndi.
  - Any **uncompleted Gregor tasks are ignored** and **omitted from the report** due to the emergency (Lannet does not finish them).
  - The dog’s behavior follows the state established in 7.c (barking → anxious/quiet).

**Transition**

- Proceed to **Act 8: Heading Back** (main stairs).
- Gregor-related flags (e.g., witnessed vs absent, doctors present, room empty) carry forward for subtle echoes in **Break** and **Goodbye**.

---

## **Act 8: Reporting Back – Quick Reaction Tutorial**

**Narrative**

- Regardless of how Act 7 unfolded, Lyndi and Lannet head back to the head nurse's office.
- They go down the stairs and walk along a corridor. Suddenly, a medical team rushes past with a patient, shouting for everyone to clear the way.
- At this moment, a **quick reaction prompt** appears for the player to press the action button.

**Quick Reaction**

- **Success**: If pressed in time, Lyndi dodges out of the way. They continue to the head nurse's office without any interruptions.
- **Fail**: If missed, Lannet pushes Lyndi aside, scattering their collected charts. Both nurses must pick up the scattered charts before proceeding.

**Chart Collection**

- If charts are scattered, Lannet picks up most of them, but not all.
- Any uncollected charts are missing from the final report.
- The number of charts Lannet picks up depends on her frustration level:
  - **High Frustration**: Lannet collects fewer charts.
  - **Low Frustration**: Lannet collects more charts.

**Subtle Dialog Prompt – Mr. Gregor’s Passing**

- If Lyndi witnessed Mr. Gregor’s passing in Act 7:
  - A subtle dialog prompt appears while walking, allowing Lyndi to bring it up.
  - The prompt remains active until the quick reaction begins.
  - Engaging with it increases Lannet’s respect, even if her response is cut short.
  - Lannet’s response varies depending on Act 7:
    - *“We are nurses, get used to it.”* – if Lyndi cried and Lannet had to shake her.
    - *“Do your job next time.”* – if Lyndi ignored the dog’s barking, forcing Lannet to handle it alone.
    - *“We did our job. The doctor will take care of the rest.”* – if they both found the doctor.
    - *“We need to keep working.”* – in all other situations.

> **Impact on Lannet**
>
> - **Increased Frustration**
>   - If Lyndi fails to dodge the medical team, forcing Lannet to push her.
>   - Each chart Lannet has to pick up.
> - **Decreased Frustration**
>   - If Lyndi dodges the medical team without Lannet’s help.
> - **Increased Respect**
>   - If Lyndi collects more charts than Lannet.
>   - If Lyndi engages with the subtle dialog about Mr. Gregor’s passing.

---

## Act 9: The Nurse’s Office – Report

**Narrative**

- Lyndi and Lannet arrive at Head Nurse Deliah’s office and turn in their collected charts.
- If charts were scattered in Act 8, some may be missing. Lannet will recover most, but not all.
- If Lannet’s **frustration is high**, she delivers pointed criticisms on any applicable moments from Acts 1–8. If her frustration is **low**, she stays professional and says nothing.

**Report Flow**

- Deliah listens while Lannet reports.
- After Lannet finishes, there’s a brief pause; a **subtle Dialog** prompt appears for Lyndi (see **Ring Menu Replies**).
- When Lyndi begins to speak, Deliah **always** cuts in with: *“You’ll do better next time, won’t you, Lyndi?”* A second subtle prompt then lets Lyndi answer: *“Yes, ma’am.”*

---

- **Act 7 – Lyndi witnessed Gregor’s passing** → Lannet remains silent; during a brief pause a **subtle Dialog** prompt allows Lyndi: *“Mr. Gregor… a patient… he…”*\
  Deliah cuts in: *“I heard. He was a great man. You need to understand, Lyndi. We are nurses, and this is a hospital. This happens all the time.”*\
  A follow-up subtle prompt lets Lyndi respond: *“Yes, ma’am.”*
- **Act 8 – Lyndi fails to dodge the rushing team** → *“Doesn’t pay attention.”*
- **Act 8 – Not all charts collected** → *“She lost paperwork.”*
- **Any Act – Struggle state triggered** → *“And she can’t follow directions.”*

---

**Head Nurse Deliah’s Tempering Line**

If Lannet is critical, Deliah adds:\
*“I understand you are both new nurses, and mistakes will happen. It’s better to act and make mistakes than to hesitate because you’re afraid of doing something wrong.”*

**Additional Presentation Details**

- The more critical lines Lannet delivers, the more her **frustration animation** vents (clipboard grip, posture).
- After Lannet’s report, Lyndi’s **subtle Dialog** ring lists replies **only** for acts where Lannet criticized her (below).
- Deliah’s cut-off line then plays, followed by Lyndi’s *“Yes, ma’am.”*

**Ring Menu Replies (per criticized act)**

- **Act 1** → *“I’ll work on keeping calm.”*
- **Act 2** → *“I’ll push myself harder.”*
- **Act 3** → *“I need to pick up the pace, I know.”*
- **Act 4** → *“I’ll make sure to be more attentive.”*
- **Act 5** → *“I should’ve stepped up.”*
- **Act 6** → *“I didn’t mean to pry.”*
- **Act 7** → *“I’ll be more mindful.”*
- **Act 8** → *“I know I should’ve been more aware.”*

> **Impact on Lannet**
>
> **Decreased Frustration**
>
> - Each critical line she gets to deliver (venting lowers her tension).
>
> **Increased Respect**
>
> - Turning in **all** charts.
> - Lyndi engages the subtle Dialog windows in this act (acknowledging feedback, not arguing).

## Act 10: Break – Free Roam

**Narrative:** Lyndi and Lannet part ways for break; the hospital opens up for exploration and quiet character beats.\
**Bell Tower Mechanic:**

- 1 ring → break starts
- 2 rings → halfway; Lannet begins heading toward Administration
- 9 rings → break ends; Lyndi should be at Administrator’s Office\
  **Additional Mechanic — Lyndi Absent:** If Lyndi isn’t at the office when the break ends, she’s absent from the next act.

> **Impact on Lannet**\
> **Increases Frustration:** Lyndi pesters Lannet at cafeteria until she leaves/locks the room.\

---

## Act 11: The Administrator’s Office – Call for Volunteers

### Act 11.1: Outside the Administrator’s Office – Hidden Eavesdrop Tutorial

**Narrative**

- Before the break ends, Lannet and four other nurses arrive and wait outside the Administrator’s Office. All five wait until the bell rings. Lannet keeps to herself; the other four gossip together. These nurses also graduated with Lyndi and Lannet.

**Action**

- If Lyndi arrives before the bell, she may:
  - Exchange pleasantries with the other four nurses.
  - Stand near them to listen in (eavesdrop) as they talk about the war effort and their fears.
  - Attempt to talk with Lannet (responses vary with Lannet’s frustration level).

**Lannet’s Responses**

- **Low Frustration** → *“Not now.”* / *“Stay focused.”*
- **High Frustration** → *“You all need to get a grip. We have a job to do.”*

**Bell Rings**

- When the bell rings, the office doors open and the nurses are let inside. Any ongoing conversations end immediately.

---

### Act 11.2a: The Call – Volunteers Requested

**Narrative**

- When the bell stops, the administrator steps out, closes the door behind him, and leaves the group with the **Director of the Nursing School**.

**Director’s Address**

> “Please, gather close. I have to talk to you all.”\
> “First of all, I want to tell you that I am glad to see you all well. We have not seen each other since you were assigned to this hospital.”\
> “I have come to send a nurse from our honorable school to the front. Several hospitals have already sent doctors and nurses to help the war effort. They are all hard at work. From this hospital, three doctors and five nurses have gone.”\
> “Our school will send three nurses, one of whom will be from this class. I don’t want to force you; it must be a volunteer. I want one of you to step forward.”

**Character Agency**

- Player input is restricted.
- Each time the player tries to step forward, Lyndi won’t move; inner monologue appears (hesitation, thinking of her life and friends, slowly convincing herself).
- On the **seventh attempt**, **Lannet steps forward instead**.
- If Lyndi makes no attempts, Lannet still steps forward after a pause.

**Dismissal**

- After Lannet steps forward, the director dismisses the group. The other four leave, relieved. Lyndi may:
  - Exit with them.
  - Stay in the office (the director eventually asks her to leave).
  - Stay in the hall (Lannet eventually emerges, leading into Act 12).

---

### Act 11.2b: Late – Forced Selection

**Narrative**

- If Lyndi is not outside the office when the bell rings, the others go in without her. When the bell stops, the administrator steps out, closes the door, and leaves.

**Player Options**

- If Lyndi enters **before** the administrator closes the door → Act 11.2a plays normally.
- If she arrives **too late**:
  - The administrator walks to the cafeteria. If he passes Lyndi: *“She will have to decide.”* (about the director)
  - After the meeting, the nurses file out: *“The director is waiting for you.”*
  - Inside, the director: *“You have been selected to help with the war effort. Gather your things and set your affairs in order. We leave in the morning.”*
  - Lyndi is dismissed; the act ends when she leaves the hall.
  - If she delays too long, a message appears: *“You have been selected for the war effort.”* → proceed to epilogue.

---

### Additional Notes

**Lannet’s Role**

- Lannet **always volunteers** unless her **frustration is maxed out**.
- If maxed, she refuses; Lyndi can step forward instead.
- If Lyndi also doesn’t step forward, the director **selects Lannet anyway**.

**Frustration Mechanics**

- One path to max frustration: Lyndi **absent in Act 9**, preventing Lannet from venting her criticisms.

**Alternate Path (Act 12b)**

- If frustration is maxed and Lyndi volunteers, she replaces Lannet, leading to **Act 12b**.

---

#### Impact on Lannet

**Increase Frustration**

- Lyndi being late or absent.
- Attempting to talk to Lannet when she’s already frustrated.

**Decrease Frustration**

- Arriving early and exchanging pleasantries with the other nurses.
- Standing by Lannet when the director speaks.

**Increase Respect**

- Every attempt Lyndi makes to step forward, even if she ultimately can’t.

---

### **Act 12a: Goodbye Lannet**

---

## **Narrative**

This act begins after Act 11.2a, when Lannet volunteers to go to the front. The director asks Lyndi to step outside while he goes over details with Lannet.

- **Transition:** Stepping into the hallway marks the start of Act 12.
- Lyndi can:
  - Leave the hall immediately → transitions to the **epilogue**.
  - Wait until Lannet exits → follow her to the lobby, ending without incident.
  - Attempt to speak to Lannet (twice) → unlocks the **subtle dialog prompt.**

---

### **Initial Exchange**

After waiting, Lannet exits the office.

- Lyndi: *“Lannet…”*
- Lannet: *“Not now.”* (keeps walking)
- Lyndi: *“Lannet, I need—”*
- Lannet: *“I don’t have time.”*

**Subtle Dialog Prompt** appears:

- Lyndi: *“Let me take your place.”*

Lannet stops, turns back, and glares at her:

> **“What?”**

This begins their **final conversation**.

---

### **Conversation Dynamics**

- Lannet begins with her current **frustration** and **respect** values carried over from earlier acts.
- Lyndi’s replies can:
  - Increase or decrease **frustration**.
  - Increase **respect**.
- **Threshold Rule:** If frustration passes a set threshold, the conversation ends abruptly.
- If frustration is managed or reduced, the conversation continues further down the hallway.

---

## **Hallway Mechanics**

- Unlike the stairwell conversation in Act 6, this scene’s pacing varies with dialog choices.
- Lannet may stop, move closer to Lyndi, or walk farther away during lines.
- Lyndi must **stay near Lannet** to continue.
- If the conversation ends because Lyndi falls behind (distance too great), this adds to **Lannet’s frustration.**

---

## **Threads of Conversation**

Each **thread** represents a progression of related replies.

- Once a thread is exhausted, it disappears, leaving a blank slot in the ring menu.
- Unlock conditions control which threads appear (see below).

---

### **Threads and Replies**

**1. Stay for Your Family**

- Always available.
- 5 replies: first 4 → increase frustration.
- 5th reply → Lyndi admits she’s nosy and apologizes → lowers frustration & increases respect.

**2. Nurse and War**

- Unlock: Ms. Liya’s conversations.
- 4 replies, all lower frustration.

**3. You Are a Good Nurse**

- Unlock: patient opinions about Lannet.
- Mixed sub-branches: some replies raise frustration, others lower it.
- Special reply (from Tina): raises both frustration & respect.

**4. We Could Be Friends**

- Unlock: Lyndi’s self-reflection in their shared room.
- Lowers frustration.

**5. Something About Her Stuff**

- Unlock: if Lyndi went through Lannet’s belongings.
- Lannet interrupts angrily → sharp increase in frustration.

**6. The Future**

- Unlock: Mr. Gregor + Ms. Zoe conversations.
- Mixed: some replies raise respect, others raise frustration.

**7. I Admire You**

- Unlock: stairwell conversation (Act 6).
- Variants:
  - Frustrating variant → lowers frustration.
  - Somber variant → first 2 replies raise frustration; 3rd raises respect.
  - Reflective variant → same as Somber (frustration first, respect last).

**8. Never Mind**

- Always available.
- Adds frustration.
- If frustration exceeds threshold, Lannet snaps:

> “Who do you think you are? I told you I hate nosy people. I didn’t step forward for sentimentality but because it is my duty as a nurse. I made the decision. Don’t interfere.”

She runs off, visibly upset.

---

## **End Conversation Replies**

- **High Frustration:**
  > “Just shut up, Lyndi. I don’t want to hear it. I told you I hate nosy people.”
- **Neutral:**
  > “I need to get ready.”
- **High Respect:**
  > “You are a great nurse, and you will do great here. Follow your path, and I’ll follow mine. I need to get my things in order.”

---

## **Unlock Criteria (Examples)**

- Asking Ms. Liya *“How did you lose your leg?”* → unlocks **Nurse and War**.
- Talking with Ms. Liya in the garden → adds more replies to that thread.
- Speaking with a ward veteran → unlocks another reply.
- Multiple conditions can stack (e.g., Ms. Liya + a veteran unlocks two replies at once).

---

## **Frustration vs Respect Balance**

- **Frustration** is cumulative (input, distance, hostile choices).
- **Respect** is a counterweight: higher respect raises the frustration threshold, making it harder for Lannet to end the talk abruptly.
- Lower respect lowers the threshold, making her quicker to snap.

---

## Act 12b: Goodbye, Lyndi

**Trigger**

- This act occurs if **Lannet’s frustration is maxed** in **Act 11.2a**, preventing her from volunteering.
- Lyndi steps forward instead, taking the role.

**Narrative Setup**

- After the meeting ends, Lyndi exits the office.
- If **respect is high**, Lannet is waiting in the hallway to speak first.
- If **respect is low**, the hall is empty. Lyndi leaves alone, and the act ends in silence, transitioning to the epilogue.

---

### Conversation (High Respect)

- For once, Lannet initiates. Lyndi may interrupt or let her finish.

**Interruption Path**

- Subtle prompt during Lannet’s words.
- Lyndi interrupts: *“I wish we could have been friends.”*
- Lannet pauses, then quietly:
  > *“I never liked you, Lyndi… because of your cheerfulness, and your meddling… But I know you will be a great nurse. I hope for your safe return.”*
- She then leaves.

**No Interruption Path**

- If Lyndi stays silent, she replies afterward:
  - *“Thank you, Lannet. I really appreciate you being at my side.”*
- Lannet’s eyes well slightly:
  > *“Take care, Lyndi.”*
- She then exits.

---

## **Act 12: Aftermath**

**Narrative Flow**

- Reaching the end of the hallway and exiting into the lobby ends Act 12 in any situation.
- The act will also end if Lyndi is not engaged in conversation for a period of time.
- Certain actions from Lannet can also bring the act to a close, such as:
  - Lannet reaching the end of the hallway.
  - The conversation ending due to the frustration threshold being reached.
  - Choosing the **“Never Mind”** option, which snaps the moment shut.
  - Lannet finishing her conversation in **Act 12b**.

Once the act ends, the frame shifts upward and fades to black, leading into the **epilogue**.

---

> **Impact on Lannet**
>
> **Increase Frustration**:
>
> - Selecting replies that raise frustration.
> - Opting for **“Never Mind.”**
> - Bringing up overly personal topics, such as her belongings.
>
> **Decrease Frustration**:
>
> - Choosing replies that ease tension, such as the **“Nurse and War”** or **“We Could Be Friends”** threads.
> - Offering apologies or sincere reflections when appropriate.
>
> **Increase Respect**:
>
> - Navigating the conversation well and avoiding excessive frustration.
> - Choosing replies that genuinely acknowledge Lannet’s strengths or actions, such as those in the **“I Admire You”** thread.

---

## **Epilogue**

- **Trigger**: Acts **11.2b**, **12a**, and **12b** all lead directly into the epilogue.

- **Transition**:

  - After the conclusion of the preceding act, the frame pans upward and fades to black.
  - In the case of **Act 11.2b**, if Lyndi was not explicitly informed that she had been selected, the text *“Lyndi was selected to support the war effort”* briefly appears on the black screen before fading out.
  - The epilogue then begins: the screen fades in from black to the outside of the hospital. The frame slowly pans downward, revealing a group of hospital staff gathered outside. A carriage waits nearby, prepared to depart.

---

### **Epilogue A: Lannet’s Departure**

- **Narrative**: The screen fades back to the outside of the hospital. A group of nurses has gathered, and a carriage waits nearby. The director and Lannet walk down the line of nurses toward the carriage, with Lyndi standing among them. As they reach the end, just before boarding, Lannet pauses.

- **Lannet’s Action**:

  - **High Frustration**: Lannet gets into the carriage without looking back.
  - **Neutral**: Lannet turns to face the gathered nurses and says, *“Thank you, all of you,”* before boarding the carriage.
  - **High Respect**: Lannet first addresses the crowd as in the neutral scenario, then approaches Lyndi directly. She says, *“Take care, Lyndi.”* After a pause, she returns to the carriage, ready to depart. A subtle dialog prompt appears, giving Lyndi the chance to respond:

    **Lyndi’s Possible Replies**:

    - *“Take care, too, Lannet.”*
    - *“We’ll see each other again, Lannet.”*
    - *“Thank you, Lannet.”*

    **Lannet’s Reactions**:

    - If Lyndi says *“Take care, too, Lannet,”* she wipes a single tear from her eye.
    - If Lyndi says *“We’ll see each other again, Lannet,”* she wipes away tears with both hands.
    - If Lyndi says *“Thank you, Lannet,”* she lets out a soft snivel before wiping her tears with her sleeve. This option triggers a **quick reaction prompt**: if the player succeeds, Lyndi hugs Lannet before she leaves. This is only available if Lannet’s frustration is low.

- **Carriage Departure**: Regardless of the exchanges, Lannet eventually boards the carriage. The director delivers a few final words to the assembled nurses before climbing aboard as well. The carriage departs, the screen pans upward, and then fades to white, bringing the game to an end.

---

### **Epilogue B: Lyndi’s Departure**

- **Trigger**: This epilogue occurs if Lyndi was not present for the meeting and was chosen to volunteer or if she stepped forward in **Act 11.2a** when Lannet’s frustration was maxed out.

- **Narrative**: The scene mirrors Epilogue A, but the roles are reversed. Lyndi is walking with the director toward the carriage, and Lannet is among the nurses gathered outside.

- **Lyndi’s Action**:

  - Before Lyndi can board, a **character agency sequence** occurs, where the player briefly loses control. After two attempts, control is regained, and Lyndi boards the carriage.

- **Subtle Dialogue**: During the character agency sequence, a subtle dialogue prompt appears, allowing Lyndi to address the gathered nurses and thank them. If Lyndi chooses to speak, and if Lannet’s respect is high, she will step forward and say, *“Take care, Lyndi.”* Another subtle dialogue prompt allows Lyndi to respond:

  **Possible Replies**:

  - *“Take care, too, Lannet.”*
  - *“We’ll see each other again, Lannet.”*
  - *“Thank you, Lannet.”*

  **Lannet’s Reaction**: Similar to Epilogue A, Lannet wells up and wipes her tears differently based on the response. If Lyndi says *“Thank you, Lannet,”* there is also a **quick reaction prompt** for a hug.

- **Carriage Departure**: After the exchanges, Lyndi boards the carriage, the director addresses the nurses, and the carriage departs. The screen pans up, fades to white, ending the narrative.
