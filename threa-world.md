# World of Threa

---

Let’s create a fictional universe. This is the world of Threa, which I want to base on the flat earth concept.

---

Imagine a hollow glass sphere. The Sun and Moon resemble marbles. The Sun rolls along the outer surface of this glass, while the Moon glides on its inner surface. The hollow glass sphere is filled with water and earth up to the midpoint, with the upper half containing only air.

---

There exists a fundamental substance known as Eura, which shimmers in green, cyan, red, and magenta, occasionally sparking in blue and yellow. Threa is composed of this substance. The hollow sphere consists of raw, unshaped Eura. At the core lies the essence of Threa, encompassing all continents, oceans, weather, and civilizations. Beyond this core, Threa begins to unravel. Wisps of Eura emerge from fragments of Threa disassembling into their components or manifest as wisps of Eura coalescing into new forms. The farther from the center, the more reality dissolves into Eura, until reaching the Eural Shell, where massive, plasma-like wisps flow, churn, and wave.

The Sun and Moon are two colossal orbs that traverse the surface of the Eural Shell. The Sun rolls on the outside, while the Moon glides on the inside. They are featureless orbs, with the Sun being slightly larger. The Eural Shell is as thick as the Sun, and neither is hot nor cold. The Eura swirls in their wake. As the Sun rolls, it propels Eura into Threa, creating streams that eventually coalesce into forms as they travel through Threa, primarily transforming into light and warmth. This process occurs in an area that is quite warm, akin to an inner shell of heat, still well beyond the core, but it is where winds, waves, auroras, and magma originate. The Moon glides along the inner surface of the Eural Shell, extracting Eura from Threa, which can be experienced as tides on the surface. Jets of Eura emerge from the shell like Eural Prominence, splashing back down onto the shell.

Beyond the Sun and Moon, and the Eural Shell, lies the Void filled with Stars. Many are shapeless masses of Eura or something similar. Other stars are worlds like Threa. Some twinkle in the colors green, cyan, red, or magenta—the same colors that Eura shimmers with. There are four stars, each the brightest of their respective colors. However, there are no blue or yellow stars, which are the colors of the occasional sparks and wisps in Threa's Eura.

---

The Four Prime Elements—Earth, Water, Fire, and Wind—created Threa, which is why Eura shimmers in their respective colors. Before creating Threa, each element fashioned worlds independently but abandoned them after deeming them failures. The four bright stars are the last worlds they created before Threa. Fire and Wind created the Sun, while Water and Earth fashioned the Moon. After completing Threa, they still regarded it as a failure due to its emptiness and were prepared to abandon it when Ice and Lightning emerged. Ice is the son of Earth and Water, while Lightning is the daughter of Fire and Wind. Together, the Neo elements introduced Life into Threa—plants, animals, and sentience. This is why Eura sparks in blue and yellow; when green and cyan Eura clash, it sparks blue, and when red and magenta Eura collide, it sparks yellow. This explains why no stars shine in blue or yellow light. Ice and Lightning originate from Threa and have not ventured far from it, let alone created a world.

At mid-summer noon, the Sun is at its zenith atop the Eural Shell. As the day progresses, it rolls westward along the shell's surface. When it sets, it descends into the remnants of the ocean, crossing the equatorial plane. As it travels beneath the ocean and earth, it becomes night. It continues on its journey, emerging from the Eural ocean in the east, crossing the equatorial plane once more, and moving westward back to its highest point at noon, which is lower than the previous day as its path around the Eural Shell has shifted slightly. This procession will gradually lower the Sun closer to the horizon until mid-winter, when it will be halfway between its peak and the horizon, beginning to rise again. Once more, at mid-summer, the Sun will be directly overhead.

As it moves, it pushes Eura into Threa. High in the sky, most of it coalesces into light and warmth, while closer to the horizon, it becomes less light and warmth, and more wind, which is why it appears red at sunset. As it plunges into the dark waters, it influences the ocean currents, and as it travels beneath the earth, it heats it into magma. Similarly, as it approaches sunrise, the Moon follows a different path and speed, pulling Eura from Threa, affecting the winds and currents, influencing the tides, and extracting heat. When the Sun and Moon align, the Sun is positioned directly above the Moon, resulting in a solar eclipse.

Moon Phases: At any given moment, one side of the Moon faces the Sun. The Sun throws Eura into Threa, some of which reaches the Moon. The location where it lands is where the Moon glows. From the perspective at Threa's core, a different side of the Moon is visible than the one facing the Sun. The overlap of these two sides gives rise to the phases of the Moon.

---

The Eural Jet, which the Moon pulls, occasionally clashes with the Eural stream, which the Sun emits. This disruption causes the Eura that lands on the Moon to create a lunar eclipse.

---

All of this is unknown to the inhabitants of Threa. They reside at the core, where the sky appears quite similar to real life. The Element brought forth 21 people in Threa. They go about their lives oblivious to the actual nature of the world. They have developed various theories, including a flat disk model, a sun-centered model, and even a moon-centered model. Only two, the Aetha and the Dreavi, are aware. They were the second group to be formed. Ice and Lightning first created the Nawa. From that knowledge, Fire and Wind brought forth the Aetha, while Earth and Water created the Dreavi. All three groups know of their origins, but the Prime Element ultimately entrusted Threa to the Aetha and Dreavi. Both of them comprehend the essence of Threa. With considerable effort, they can reach the edge at the Eural shell, but not beyond. They can also influence the Sun and Moon, though with great difficulty. They nurture and care for Threa, maintaining mountains and forests, guiding the rivers and winds, shaping the weather, and directing the seasons, all while the remaining 18 races of Threa remain unaware of the true nature of their world.

If it were feasible, and I were to ascend from the ground towards the sun, the journey would begin modestly. As I gain altitude, I would rise above the clouds and the highest mountains. It would get hot where the auroras shine, but as I ascend further up the sky, the temperature would begin to drop. Wisps of Eura would appear and disappear. The air disintegrates, light and warmth take shape. the Eura transforms into air, warmth and light. Upon reaching the edge, I would find only streams of Eura flowing into Threa and out again, resembling plasma at a star's surface. The Sun is a colossal orb rolling along this outer boundary, as if navigating a sea of Eura. From this vantage point, it does not feel hot. The warmth and light we experience on the surface originate from the Eura as the sun casts it into Threa behind it. The place where I first noticed the wisps and last felt warmth is where the descending Eura transforms into light and heat.

The moon, situated not far from the sun, draws geysers of Eura in its trail, expelled from Threa, akin to solar prominences in reality. These geysers arc and eventually return to this sea of Eura.

This time, I will journey across its surface. I traverse mountains and forests, villages and kingdoms, solid continents, and the vast blue oceans. We depart from the last shore, with no more land in this direction. The blue waters deepen into a rich blue, then turn black. Everything begins to grow warmer. The black waters and winds grow more turbulent. This is due to the water rushing to fill voids. The water, air, and everything disintegrate into wisps of Eura, while Eura also transforms into water and air. Then it grows cold. We pass a few islands, or fragments of earth, before encountering a wall of Eura. From the top of Threa, it appears like a sea, but from the surface, it resembles a wall. The Sun comes crashing down, casting Eura into Threa, and then it plunges into the remnants of the black waters. This marks the sunset, the moment when the sun dips below the horizon. If I were on the other side, the sun would rise from the remnants of the black oceans at dawn, and the moon would follow a similar pattern.

---

Returning to the surface of Threa, I find myself on a vast plain. If I were to descend through the soil, rock, and crust, similar to my previous two journeys, I would encounter a region where the heat begins to intensify. This is where magma flows, and then it starts to cool down. Eural wisps begin to appear more frequently. The ground here is not very solid; one could fall through what appears to be firm earth. Eventually, I arrive at the Eural floor, the base of the enormous Eura globe that encompasses Threa. Above me, an earthen ceiling resembles a cavern, with flecks of dirt cascading down and dissipating into Eura. The colossal orb of the Moon glides along this floor, drawing Eura downward. Eventually, during the night, the Sun will pass through this area, pushing Eura upward.

---

One final expedition. The last shore. Yet instead of moving along its surface, we dive beneath the waves. As we descend a gentle slope, not much differs from other lakes and oceans in Threa’s core. Life continues to flourish here. Traversing the underwater landscape, we come across plains, mountains, and cliffs. We go deeper still—then we encounter a sheer drop: the Abyssal Cliff.

This is where the black waters begin at the surface. We descend the abrupt drop until we reach the abyssal floor. Even in this inky darkness, life persists. Thermal vents and lava flows exist deep underwater, right at the boundary of the black waters.

We advance further into the abyss. These deep waters are tranquil, yet completely dark—no light can penetrate this gloom. The floor is flat, with no further descent. Further out, the water becomes warmer. Then, Eural wisps begin to emerge. The water grows more turbulent as it transforms into Eura—or Eura transitions into water. Droplets simply float in emptiness.

Once again, I arrive at the Eura Barrier. The Edge of Threa. As before, the Sun and Moon traverse this space, pushing Eura into Threa or drawing it out.

if we travel far beyond the Eural surface, far beyond so we can see all of Threa. We see a sphere, a globe. not of glass but the fundamental Eura. the top half is filled with air, with the sky and clouds. right at its equator is the flat surface. the sea, the waves and eventually the continents at its center.  The bottom is half filled with water. At the very bottom is an earthen base. The Sun and the Moon are two orbs that roll on the surface of the Eural globe. the sun on the outside, the moon on the inside. in the occasion where they align and stack on each other is what we experience on the surface as an eclipse. they push and pull this fundamental substance in its wake. unraveling and reforming the edges of Threa as they go. When the Sun rolls along the lower hemisphere, it is night. and as it travels along the upper hemisphere. it is day.

from this vantage. Threa looks like a star. so, are the star other worlds like Threa? are they masses of fundamental Eura, or have they been shaped into worlds. Threa was shaped by the Elements: Earth, Water, Fire and Wind.  have the elements, or other like them, made other worlds that we see as stars. The Eura glimmers in their colors: Green, Cyan, Red and Magenta. there are four stars that shine in those colors. did the elements shape those stars into worlds. if so. I wonder how Threa looks as a star in their skies.

---

Those four stars are the brightest in their color. But there a few other stars of similar colors. Still, there are no stars that shine blue nor yellow. The colors of ice and lighting. Those colors spark every so often in Threa's Eura, but it is fully absent from the stars

---

The elements are beings. They created Threa. But before, they created worlds on their own. But those worlds failed in their opinion and subsequently abandoned them. They then collaborated together to make Threa. From their collaboration is what caused ice and lighting to emerge. The absence of blue and yellow stars is because ice and lighting emerged from threa. Which is why Threa's Eura has blue and yellow sparks.
