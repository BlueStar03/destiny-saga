Minka are at a constant state of war among themselves. this, however is deliberate. they do not seek control, dominance, resources, nor expansion. simply it is bloodlust. They have a season of war that typically last 2 years. it may be extended, by mutual agreement of the queens, up to five years. it may last shorter if there are enough surrenders to declare a winner. after the season of war, come a five year season of peace.  during the season, each tribe ribuilds, getting ready for the next season of war. the victor does get some privilage over the other tribe, but also so restrictions are imposed, to prevent them from gaining an unfair advantage for the next season war. all sides honor the fallen. at various intervals of the war season, the bodies of all the fallen, from all sides, are burned together in a joint funeral pyre. Many outsider see this war season as internal conflict, and try to take advantage of that and take over their territory. however, as soon as intruders are detected, all warring parties immediately form an alliance and direct their efforts against the intruders. once the intruders are dealt with, the alliance dissolves, they call it a day and resume their war the next day. their weapon of choice is the whip, including ribbons, ropes and chains.

All warrior are exclusively female. The season of peace is declared after the season of war has lasted two years. The victor is the tribe with the best standing. More warriors, fewer losses, a functioning economy, and other factors determine who won. The victor is granted certain privileges. like gloating about their victory, lowered tax rate, taking resources from the other tribes. However, one important limitation is the reduction of population growth. Minkas are primarily born during the season of peace. with a few born during the season of war. Two war seasons later, the Minka would be old enough to participate in war. The victor is limited to how many can be born in their tribe. Anything beyond the agreed amount will be given to the other tribes. The other tribes are not capped and ca expand their populations. The season of peace lasts five years. during the first four, they rebuild, reestablish festivities, and may even forge alliances for the next season of war. on the last year of the season of peace, Warriors are trained and mobilized, they bid farewell to their families and get ready to start. The day before the season of war begins, a huge feast among all the tribes is held. The queens express their hopes for the upcoming season of war. The next day, war is declared.

Minka are born during the season of peace, mainly during the first year. Their fathers maintain the Household and care for their children, while the mother provides for the house and trains for the upcoming season of war. They bid farewell to their mothers at the end of the season of peace. hoping for their safe return. during the war season they are not necessarily safe. the other tribes may attack their villages. the best outcome would be if they and their parent survive the war season. but it is more common than not that at least one family member is lost. during their second season of peace. females start training for war. they will not participate in the second war season but on their third, if the survive that long.  By their third peace season they are now adults and have their place in society, the practice their occupation and may even start a family. their third war season is the first they will participate. the more seasons they survive, they greater their prestige. eventually they may challenge the queen for that title.

The only ones with a sense of security are those in the medical field. because the knowledge required to practice medicine, and their vital role in the survivality of warriors, all tribes have agreed that medic are off limits. in turn, medic remain non combatants. medical casualties do happen. If one is discovered, the days fighting is called off. all parties then honor the fallen medic. war resumes as normal the next day.  because of the relative safety medics enjoy, they have unique perspective in various aspects of life. During peace season, they are sought after for advice and guidance, even from leadership. Some attempt to be taken ins as a medical apprentice, either to serve the warriors of their tribe, or as a means to shield themselves from constant war

Ladies, Dames, and Maids. Ladies are the ruling class, Maids are everyone else. with Dame referring when they are acting as warriors. Maids can assume ladyship by challenging a lady. The challenge must be done in fair conditions. By successfully besting a lady, the maid assumes the defeated ladyship, while the defeated lady loses her ladyship and becomes a maid. If unsuccessful nothing happens. that is if they survive the challenge. This also includes the queen. If there is no challenge, the ladyship passes to whomever the lady chooses, typically their eldest daughter.

At the Eve of War, the last week of the Peace Season, the current Victor tribe hosts the queens and their Dames (Warriors) at their capital village. They feast to celebrate the upcoming War Season. a week after, the War Season begins. The Dames and a few Maids leave their towns and villages and enter the jungle. once inside they form warbands. they consist of no more than 15 a mix of Dames and Maids, but mostly dames They all wear something of the color of their tribe, an armband, sash, ribbons or anything. the maids perform one of to functions, the healer or runner. healers tend the wounded, not just their own warband or tribe, but all wounded. runners move across the jungles, delivering messages, orders and supplies. Both wear distinctive armbands and are off limits from all dames.
