In the World of Threa, there are 21 races. This is a description of a race that lives in the world of Threa, the Lauril. That I will describe

---

on their apearance Lauril have green skin and darker green hair. they eyes have pink irises and yellow sclera. their lips have a slight hue of blue, and so do their freckles and other skin blemish. They have wild and puffy hair, tends to be curly and kinky hair. they have three fingers and two toes. they wear minimal clothing, tall boots, short shorts and a sleeveless shirt. females wear a flower that represent their tribe. males wear a feather from the bird that represents their tribe. they both also wear an armband with the color of their tribe. elders wear longer shirts and sandals.Elders they may also wear shalls.

The lauril are direct democracy absolute monarchy. The elected monarch has absolute authority on everything, until the next election. however, the monarch is actually a puppet. true power lies with the council of elder. they manipulate the monarch into believing it was their idea. The office of the monarch is purely to placate the youths. Elections can happen at any time, so their rule may not even last a day. thou a couple of months is common, and the same individual may hold the office multiple times. no term limits. while technically their word is law, there commands tend to be silly request, like applaud when they enter the room. and the next monarch may void them. for actual governance and policy, someone from the council of elders would suggest, if it were a good idea, to implement a certain policy. More often than not, the monarch would take that suggestion an run with it as if it were their idea. one the rare occasions in which the monarch refuses, the elders lecture and shame the monarch. they may even ground the monarch as punishment. in an extreme situation, they may force a new election. only a handful of occasion has the monarch stood their ground and flexed their absolute power against the council of elders.

Their society is a sad reality of wasted potential. the youth, who have capable bodies, waste their time and effort perusing gratuitous pleasures. parties and competitions. they only do their job because their elders keep nagging them, with threats of grounding them. The elders with weak and frail bodies, know what is need to be done but are incapable to do it themselves. dependent on the rambunctious youths to do anything. they understand that nothing will convince the youth to be productive since they themselves were young once, and the elders of their time failed to convince them.

The Lauril have a short life span. they tend to not live passed 50 years.they also suffer from rapid ageing. a 15y old looks like a 20y, and a 40y look like a 70y old. however. their rapid ageing is caused by their diet high on sugars. lowering their sugar intake will slow their rate of ageing and even lengthen their lifespan. However, since they pursue instant gratification, it is next to impossible to convince the youth to stop eating sweets. once they figure the negative effect, it is to late to reverse them. the damage is done.

there is a particularity on family dynamics. lauril are effectively abandoned at birth. Their parents take the newborn and place them at the center of a flower patch. this flower patch has five different flowers, representing the five tribes. an elder from each tribe is also present. there are also five types of birds in the flower patch. whichever color of flower or bird the child gravitates to, the elder represented by the chosen flower or bird adopts the child. this is most likely the last time that they ever see their biological parents. nobody makes a record of this and that knowledge is lost. if they ever cross in passing, no one would realize that, as if they were total strangers. However, the elder is to frail to raise the child. the elder assigns the child to an adult couple to be the child's parent. the adoptive parent only do so because the elder demands it. like any responsibility, young lauril try to avoid it. the elder will still be part of the child's life, assuming the role of grandparent. The adoptive grandparent provide love and care and guidance to the child. a strong bond forms between the child and the adoptive grandparent. The laurel loves and respects their grandparent. the council of elders use the monarchs grandparent to manipulate them. as such, when a lauril is elected a monarch, their grandparent temporary joins the council of elders. The adoptive parents only provide for the child. Once the child comes of age, the parent are gone.

Lauril don't have any military or police force. their territory possesses no strategic or resource value to any nearby kingdoms. Any transgression is dealt with mob justice, like public mocking. additionaly, the grandparent can discipline, like grounding or spanking. a common tool is the Hand Axe. A highly versatile tool, it is mainly used in various competitions. another common tool are windskipper leaves. if properly cared, Windskipper leaves levitate a short distance from the ground. they are used akin to a skateboard.
