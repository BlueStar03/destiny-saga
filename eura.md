# Eura

I will describe The Creation of Threa.

---

i am trying to think of an universal, primordial substance/ energy. like mana, the force, Chi. it will have the name Eura

---

there are primordial beings that are made of Eura. The Eura takes on the aspect of those beings. they can shape Eura into more "permanent" shapes. the one who gave shape to the mountains, the ground and bones is called "Earth". the one that shaped eura into rivers, lakes, oceans and blood is called "Water". the one that shaped light, warmth and emotions is referred to as "Fire". and the one that shaped the air, breath and thought is known as "Wind"

---

the primordial are flawed characters. like the greek pantheon.  from "Fire" and  "Wind" , "Lightning" came to be. she is thought and emotion, she is energy, that which acts. "Earth" and "Water" brought forth "Ice". He is matter, shape and motion, firmness and flow, That what is acted upon.

---

it is these six that shaped the Eura into the world of Threa. the first four, the prime elements, created the world itself. they shaped Eura into the land, the sky, the oceans and volcanoes. Fire and Wind shaped the sun, while Earth and Water shaped Eura into the Moon. their children, the neo elements, brought life into the world, ice made the plants, life that is acted upon, while lightning shaped the animals, life that acts. together, Ice and Lightning brought sentient life, life which acts, and is acted upon 

---

the people of Threa can access the Eura around them. however, they are unable to give it a "real" form, at least not without immense effort. "Earth" can take Eura and shape it into a block of stone, that can be used as part of a wall that protects a castle for centuries and beyond. a person can, with focus, shape Eura into what looks and behaves like a stone, but as soon as the person stops focusing on it, it despates back to Eura. Alternatively, a person could manipulate something already shaped, something already "real". so rather than placing focus to shape Eura into an eura fire, they can focus on the Eura in "real" fire, like from a torch, and manipulate that instead 

---

As mentioned earlier, Eura takes on the properties of the element that touched it. as such, aside of the ever present Raw Eura, there is elemental eura, Fire Eura, Wind eura, Earth Eura, Water Eura, Ice Eura and Lightning Eura. while never fully devoid, elemental eura is present in different densities at different places. a volcano would have an abundance of fire eura, but little water eura. or a lake would have an abundance of water eura, and little fire eura. it is this what mortals focus on and shape. when they focus, they sense the Eura around them. each race has an affinity to one or two elements. The Lor, the people created by Fire, are attuned to fire eura. when they focus, it is easier to sense fire eura than any other kind. they can still access any other kind of elemental eura, but it is harder. in a volcano, with an abundance of fire eura, they can more easily "grab a handful" and shape it, thus throwing a fireball. in contrast, underwater, they would struggle to grasp a few wisp of fire eura to cast a small fireball. A lor can still use water eura, but it is harder, requires a greater focus for them to sense it. 

---

Raw Eura exist, it is colorless (Black and white). it is not common inside Threa. it is abundant outside of it, but inside threa, the elemental Eura is more abundant. think of it like clay. a fresh packege of clay is like raw eura, untouched by the artisan, in a nice block. but the clay in the vase has been touched by the artisan, be it the clay that has been baked or leftover, that is elemental eura, shaped and unshaped. but threa had four artisan, each gave different properties to the clay that is Eura. it is the leftover, unshaped Eura that mortals sense and grasp. or the baked, shaped eura that can be manipulated.

The Sun and Moon are not like the traditional sense, but are two featureless orbs that go around Threa. the sun pushes eura into Threa, while the moon pulls Eura out. it is the eura that the sun pushes in, that eventually takes the shape of light and warmth. it also takes other shapes as it reaches the surface of threa, like winds and waves. the moon pulls out eura, it pulls on the water, forming the tides, and it pulls on the air, forming winds. but as it, nears the moon, it unravels into elemental eura

---

Lighting and ice, are different to fire, wind, earth and Water. Those with affinity to fire have an easier time sensing fire eura, and a harder time sensing the other ones. Those with affinity to a neo element, like ice, have it the easiest sensing ice, but still have ease with water and earth, the parents of ice. In fact, earth and Water eura, both in equal portions, can be shaped as if it were Ice Eura. Similar with lighting and fire and wind. Additionally, someone with a prime afinity does have some ease with sensing the respective neo elemental eura, and can even replace, say use lightning eura to cast fireball. 

---

There are 21 races in Threa. 6 of those were created by one element, they are the pures. The rest were a collaboration between two elements. Of those, 3 were created by each element couple: Fire and Wind , Earth and Water , Ice and Lighting. These three races are the Perfects. The rest, a collaboration of two elements, are the Unions . The genre of creation to which a race belongs influences their affinity. Using the Pures as baseline, their affinity is 2x. That is with the same amount of focus, a Lor, the race create by Fire, can grab twice as much fire eura than with any other. and 1.5x with the relative affinity, lighting. unions, with two affinities, are at 1.5x, relative affinities are 1.25x and 1x with all else.
The Perfect, their affinities are 6x, their relative affinities are 3x and 2x with all others. And for the created by Ice and Lighting, the Nawa, they are 6x with Ice and Lightning, and 3x with Fire, Wind, Earth and Water

Certain races are more attuned to certain elements than others. A lor, a creation of fire, would use less focus than a dis com, a creation of Earth, when casting fireball. And likewise, fire skills are easier to learn for a Lor than for a Dis Com, say 100exp for a lor and 400exp for a dis com. 

The world has a baseline level of each Eura type. It isn't a pool, but a resource that is ever present. But some areas are more saturated than others. it could be described as they are focusing to feel the fire eura around them, reaching into it, channeling it and giving it form. the more they focus, the more they can feel, thus the more they can grab. in a volcano, with more fire mana saturation, it is easier to sense, and they grab more, and where there is less saturation, it is harder to sense, and they grab less.

Verra, Brima, Myrr and Rynn are cultural terms that refer to Eura, or specifically to Earth Eura, Water Eura, Fire Eura, or Wind Eura. they originated with the Dis Com, Ma Hir, Lor and Aria. and these terms propagated to the other races, other cultures. in general, they call the Eura they have an affinity to by their cultural term. a Lor for example may call fire eura as Myrr, while a Murai, having fire affinity but use a different cultural term, would call fire eura as Brima. other forms of eura may have differing cultural terms. a Lor would call water eura as water Myrr, while a murai may call it weak brima. in turn, a Ma hir would call Water Eura as Brima, and fire eura as faint brima, along side wind and earth Eura. 

Ice and Lightning Eura dont have their own cultural terms. 

---

There are 21 races in threa. six of them were created by a single element. Frill, Duga, Dis Com, Ma Hir, Lor and Aria were created by Ice, Lightning, Earth, Water, Fire and Wind. The rest were created by two elements. the Morts, for example, were created by Ice and Fire. This doesn't mean they use the term Myrr since fire is one of their creators. the names propagated culturally. in the creation of Threa, the Nawa were created first, followed by the Aetha and Dreavi. it was the Aetha and Dreavi that coind the term Eura. the Dis Com, Ma Hir, Lor and Aria were the next ones created. they coined their respective terms. 
then six more, and six other followed. the term, or terms they adopted rsulted on their interactions with the aetha and dreavi, or with Dis Com, Ma Hir, Lor and Aria. 
the last ones to be created were the Frill and the Duga. they are uniquely attuned to Ice and Lightning Eura. but since they came to existence into a world already populated, they never coined their own term, but adopted an existing one.

---

there are four plus two types of Eura: Earth, Water, Wind and Fire, as well a s Lighning and Ice. Ice and Lightning are unique. The four prime elements created an empty Threa. they were ready to abandon Threa. but from Fire and Wind, emerged Lightning , and from Earth and Water, emerged Ice. the two Neo Elements filled Threa with life, and the created the first race to step on Threa, the Nawa. 
because of the relationships of the elements, earth and water eura are equivalent to ice eura, and fire and wind eura are equivalent to lighting eura. to throw a fireball, they can use fire eura or lighning eura. however, if they want to throw a bolt of lighting, they either use lightning eura, or both fire and wind eura.   

---

the forms that a user shapes the eura into is not a "real" thing. if i make an ice shard, its not like it will melt into water, then evaporate, form into clouds, and rain into a lake. the ice shard is temporary, and will soon return back as ice eura. same with evryting else. if i throw a fireball, the fire will revert back to the fire eura that was used to form it

---

there will still be effects, but like for example, if someone shapes Verra into a brick. the can essentially cast bricks and build a house, for free. of if one is thirsty, cast water into a cup, or cast cup and the water, and drink the water. 
in starwars, there is force lightning. can the emperor charge batteries? in legend of korra, they do have lightning benders working at an electrical power plant. in harry potter, there is a rule that food cant be conjured out of nothing, or else world hunger is solved.  
basically, i am avoiding an infinite stuff glitch

---

this is Eura shaped by a person, a mortal. in contrast to the Elements. the prime elements, in effect created the forces of nature. while the neo elements created the pulse of life. two engines that tap into Eura and drive Threa. a stone that weathers across eons, water that rains into a lake and flows to the oceans, to later raise into clods, and rain back. to a heart the beats and breath that flows. even if the most skilled and capable are able to shape the Eura into a person, it will soon dissolve back into Eura not much after they stop focusing. in contrast to the generations of life that have existed since ice and lightning filled Threa with it.

---

but they can also use eura not just to shape it, but to also influence what exist. Varra can be shaped into a stone, or to move a stone. one can use myrr to set a log on fire, and then to spread that that fire. closer to the bending in avatar, the last airbender.

---

The Murai, created by Fire and Earth, are attuned to Myrr and Varra. they just refer to both as Brima. They have developed methods to channel the Brima, Eura within themselves, essentially their life force, into objects, to act as storage devices. in particularly, their armors. they can fill their armors with Brima, to later use to enhance themselves in combat.
it is the Brima within themselves, from the pulse of life, that they use. if the use raw Eura, it will dissipate back to Eura.

---

it isnt like mana generation systems like in Frieren: Beyond Journey's End. it is their very own essence than the channel and move into the armor. it is more akin to irl blood doping. in which a person extracts their own blood and stores it. then they wait until their body recovers, then the reintroduce their stored blood to their bodies, now with increased oxygen capacity. the Murai pour their blood into their armors, a conduit to move their lifeforce, their own Brima into the armor, or any object the wish. but it has to be large enough amounts in order for to sense it back so that it may be used. the initial ritual requires one third of their blood to be poured into their armor, which risks their own life. And subsequent armor maintenance also requires blood. in exchange, they have a large store of Brima readily available to them, rather than relying on ambient Brima. since it is their own life force, it is easier for them to use it.

---

a bit about murai armor . different materials have different capacities. the one that has the most capacity is the metal Azure, which is like gold, but blue. it is a soft, precious  metal that is use mainly for coins and decoration. it is otherwise unsuitable as armor, its both soft and heavy. the murai incorporate this metal into their armor. their highest capacity, heavy armor, carries 2x of an average person's life force. some of it is used to lighten the armor, so it is effectively 1.5x. Additional adornments can further increase to 2.5x. their most basic light armors carry .33x 

---

focus is the resource to used Eura. the more focus used, the more eura can be senced and use. when focus is depleted, one is unable to sense eura, thus unable to use it.
